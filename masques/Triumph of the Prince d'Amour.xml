         <p><title>TO EVERY READER.</title></p>

         <p>THe intention of this Entertainement to the Prince ELECTOR<note type="foot"><hi
                  rend="italic">Charles Lewis, elector palatine of the Rhine</hi></note>, being
            hastily prepar’d, as from eager hearts that could delay no Ceremony that might render an
            expression of their Loves: It could not be, but I must share the inconvenience of that
            hast: since length and aptitude of time is still allow’d to these Composures: And this
            (devis’d and written in three dayes) might happely have found an excuse, if the
            presentation had beene as suddenly perform’d, as it was prepar’d: but | there was a sad
            necessitie for the delay; and I may justly stile it a misfortune, that the generall
            worke could not receive the benefit of alteration by that unprofitable leasure, which
            since we have rather lost than enjoy’d. Though some Truthes are not conveniently urg’d,
            this I was forc’d to say in a malignant time, when most men strive to raise themselves a
            reputation of witt, by Cavill and Dislike.</p>

         <p> BEFORE the Scene was discovered, the Princes being prepar’d under the state at the
            upper end of the Hall; the Master of Ceremonies to the Prince D’AMOVR, receives an
            Imployment by a whisper from his Master, then moves to the Prince Elector (to whom this
            Entertainment was onely directed) and speakes this.</p>
         <lg>
            <l>SIr, this short journey from my Princes Throne,</l>
            <l>Is meant in Embassie to You alone; |</l>
            <l>To You, whom he receives not as his Ghest,</l>
            <l>For You are both his Ornament and Feast.</l>
            <l>Although his Greatnesse is not taught to bow,</l>
            <l>His Subjects feare, he will doe homage now,</l>
            <l>Which he esteemes no less’ning to his State,</l>
            <l>Since ’tis his Love decrees it, not his Fate.</l>

            <!-- 614 TRIUMPHS OF THE PRINCE D’AMOUR -->

            <l>Nay more, his Message moves so low, I feare,</l>
            <l>What sounds like tender Courtship in your eare,</l>
            <l>His Iealous Barons will dislike, and cry,</l>
            <l>I am perverted to disloyaltie;</l>
            <l>Vrge my Commission false, then taxe me for</l>
            <l>An easie Traytor, no Embassadour;</l>
            <l>As if my words would pull his Empire downe,</l>
            <l>Shorten his Scepter, and contract his Crowne;</l>
            <l>Thus whisper’d by my feares, I must impart</l>
            <l>For Ceremony now, what is his heart,</l>
            <l>Though with content of Truth, I may report</l>
            <l>You haue a num’rous Faction in his Court.</l>
            <l>This Pallace where, by sword, then law maintain’d</l>
            <l>His few, but mighty Ancestors have raign’d,</l>
            <l>Is consecrated yours; which he doth give,</l>
            <l>Not in regard he hath short time to live;</l>
            <l>For so, since his Successor is unknowne,</l>
            <l>You take what is his Subjects, not his owne, |<note type="foot"><hi rend="italic"

            <l>And what is a surrender now, would be</l>
            <l>Receiv’d to morrow as a Legacie:</l>
            <l>If more of his free love, I should relate,</l>
            <l>They’d stile it homage in our Iealous state.</l>
         </lg>

         <p>At the upper end, opposite to the state, was a stage of six foot high: and there was
            presented to sight a Front of Architecture with two Pillasters at each side, and in the
            middle of the Coronich a Compartement, with this inscription in an Ovall.</p>

         <p><title>Les Triumphes du Prince d’ Amour.</title></p>

         <p> The Curtaine flying up, on the sudden the Scene was discovered with a Village
            consisting of Alehouses and Tobacco shops, each fronted with a red Lettice, on which
            blacke Indian Boyes sate bestriding Roles of Tobacco, and in the place of Signes, Globes
            hung up, stucke up full of broken Pipes. Before each dore were seene old Loggs, and
            Trunkes of hollow Trees, on them sate the Persons of the first Anti-masque drinking, and
            making to each other such ridiculous salutes, as did intimate a joy of meeting, and
            acquaintance. This continued a while, and then they prepar’d for their first entry.

            <castItem>Two Dutch Sea Officers, a Gunner and a Boatswaine.</castItem>
            <castItem>An old over-growne debaush’d Cavalier, that seem’d unwieldy with his weight,

         <p>On the sudden, the Scene wholly changing, appeares a Campe of Tents, distinguished by
            their severall Colours: And in the middst was discover’d the Temple of Mars, the forme
            being square, and of the Dorick Order, with Trophies of Armes on the Front. Within the
            middle of the Temple stood the Statue of Mars, of Copper, upon a Pedestall.</p>

         <p> This having continu’d a while in prospect, the Priests of Mars came out of the Temple,
            cloath’d in Crimson robes, of the Antick shape, girt in the wast and being tuck’d up,
            fall in a fold; on their heads, | Miters of a Helmet forme, with a Poniard advanc’d on
            the top, and they sing this by way of Preparation.</p>

         <p>The Priests of Mars retire, and strait the Masquers appeare as coming out of severall
            Tents, their habits being Martiall and richly imbroder’d, inclining neere the old Romane
            shape; their Helmets Triumphantly plum’d, whiles the Bevir falling ore the face, serv’d
            for a disguise, and supply’d to each the office of a Vizard. These by their appearance
            and demeanour were devis’d to intimate those heroique Knights Templers, to which the
            Pallace of the Prince D’Amour was anciently Dedicated. They descend with a Majestique
            pace, and dance their first entry, then retire towards the Scene: whilst with amazement
            they discover Cupid descending in a bright cloud, who at their interview sings this.</p>

         <p>This being sung, Cupid having dispersed his darts amongst them, which charmes them from
            designes of warre to inclinations of love, they all retire.</p>
         <p>The Scene wholly changing, there appeares a square Piazza, resembling that of Venice,
            and ’tis | compos’d of Pallaces, and lesser Fabricks, with Courtizans looking out of
            windows, and Balconees, fantastically adorn’d, some in Italian, others in a Turkish
            dresse, and this prospect, prepares the second Anti-masque, who strait are discovered

         <p><title>The second Anti-masque.</title></p>

            <castItem> The second A jealous Italian Lover, who fixing his eyes on another Mistresse
               at her window, dinotes the vexation of his humour, by desperate sighes, beating on
               his breast, and sometimes a melancholly posture, standing with his Armes
               wreath’d.</castItem>

            <castItem> The third. A giddy Fantasticke French Lover, who being likewise addressed to
               some beauty, gazing at her windore, his humour is discern’d by strange ridiculous
               cringes, and frisks in his salutes, with which hee seemes to invite her acquaintance:
               having divers notes of Levitie in his habit, and wearing his Mistresse Fanne ty’d
               with a Ribband in his eare. |<note type="foot"><hi rend="italic">start of sig

            <castItem> The Fourth A dull Dutch Lover, personating some Yonker of Vtrecht, who gazing
               upwards too, doth often apply his Handkerchiefe to his eyes, as if the griefe of his
               dispaire did make him weepe.</castItem>

            <!-- APPENDIX 2 619-->

            <castItem> The Fifth A furious debaush’d English Lover, who in his habit striving to
               imitate his Neighbour (the Monsier) still outdoes his vanitie, which his accoutrement
               doth severally expresse, and he hangs in the right eare his Mistresses Muffe, in the
               left her Shooe with a Chapeen. He is not fix’d to one Balconee, but directs himselfe
               to all, offers to draw his Sword, and seemes to threaten with his fist, as he would
               rather breake their windowes, then desire them opned, that hee might gaine a looke
               from his Lady.</castItem>

         <p><stage type="mixed">These severall humors being a while artificially expressed, they
