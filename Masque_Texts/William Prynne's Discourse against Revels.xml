         <p><title>William Prynne’s Discourse against Revels</title></p>

         <p>William Prynne’s pamphlet <title>A Briefe Polemicall Dissertation</title> (1654) opens
            with an epistle addressed ‘To the Christian Reader.’ Here Prynne corroborates Bulstrode
            Whitelocke’s claim (see p 224) that Inns of Court gentlemen routinely revelled on
            Saturday nights throughout the Christmas season. Prynne supplies details – perhaps
            exaggerated – as to how long these revels lasted into the night and describes his
            attempt, which he admits was only partly successful, to suppress revels at Lincoln’s
            Inn. Prynne’s campaign may be reflected in the Lincoln’s Inn order of 29 November 1627
            (see p 218). Prynne also cites his own notorious <title>Histriomastix</title>, whose
            publication in 1633 triggered the Inns of Court masque <title>Triumph of Peace</title>
            in February 1633/4 (see Introduction, pp xxiv–xxv).</p>

         <p>KInde Reader, Give me leave to inform thee of the true Original cause impelling me to
            compile this Dissertation at least 20 years since, whiles a Prisoner in the Tower of
            London.</p>

         <p>When I was a Student and Puny Barrester in Lincolns Inne, it was the constant custome of
            that House and all other Inns of Court from All-Saints Eve, to Candlemas night, to keep
            open Revels, Dancing, Dicing and Musick

            in their Hals<note type="foot"><hi rend="italic">for</hi>every</note> ever
            Saturday night (as we usually call it) till eleven or twelve of the clock, and many
            times till 4. in the morning or later; by reason of which abuse, the Lordsday was much
            prophaned, and God<note type="foot"><hi rend="italic">for</hi>God's or good (?)</note>
            publike Ordinances on the Lordsday morning, neglected, by the Revellers, Students,
            Officers, Gamesters, Musicians and Spectators, who slept out the Forenoon Sermons and
            other divine Exercises for the most part, either in their Beds or at Church, if they
            resorted to it: Which being a great corasive to my Spirit, grief to my heart, and
            scandall to many Religious Lawyers, Students and our Lecturers. I used my best
            endeavours to reform this long continued abuse; and by my interest in some pious
            Benchers of Lincolns Inne, procured them by an Order of Counsel to suppresse all
            publique Gaming and Dicing in the Hall, with all Grand Christmasses and disorders on
            that abused Season; and likewise to restrain the length of their Revels on Saturday
            nights, by confining them to a certain houre, though they could not totally suppresse
            them, as they and I desired, being over ruled therein by the majority of the Benchers,
            pleading long prescription, custome, and unwillingnesse to displease the Revellers and
            young Students, for their continuance: Whereupon I did in my Histriomastix 
            
            <note type="Margin" rend="left"> *See the epistle Dedicatory!."</note> printed 1632.
            (Dedicated to the *Benchers of Lincolns Inne) produce the Decrees, Laws, Statutes,
            Canons of many Christian Emperours, Kings, States, Councils, and Resolutions of Fathers,
            Casuists, Schoolmen, and Protestant Divines Forraign and Domestick, to prove the
            unlawfulnesse of Stage Plays, Revels, Dancing, Gaming, Sports, and Pastimes on the
            Lordsday, and on Saturday nights, (as we usually stiled them) proving at large page 638.
            to 647. by sundry Reasons and Authorities in all ages (there cited) and likewise in the
            Table: That the Lordsday begins Saturday Evening, not at Morning or Midnight following;
            that so, I might in point of Conscience, suppresse all Revels, Gaming | and disorders
            used in our Innes of Court and elsewhere throughout the Realm, on Saturday nights, being
            part of the Lords own dayes, fit to be spent in better exercises of Piety and
            devotion.</p>
