            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
               establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
               contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
               and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
               communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
               closed the London theatres.</p>
