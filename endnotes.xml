            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
               establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
               contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
               and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
               communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
               closed the London theatres.</p>

               <ab>Dugdale summarizes this entry: see Appendix 11. Apparently Lincoln’s Inn had earlier observed or tolerated revels on many holidays, including the feasts of Saints William, Hugh, Edmund, Peter, and Thomas. These multiple holidays were now rationalized down to four, including two which persisted well into the seventeenth century: All Hallows (1 November) and the Purification of the Virgin or Candlemas (2 February). This entry is referenced by a table-of-contents type notation on f 11, annotated ‘4 Reuells fo: 20.a’ with the following summary:</ab>

            <ab>The occurrence of two different terms for harper raises the question of whether these musicians might have been playing different kinds of string instruments. Although ‘fidicen’ can refer in Anglo-Latin to a fiddler, here the performer is firmly identified in English as a harper. Despite the development in fifteenth-century Italy of the cithern, an instrument to which vocabulary derived from the Latin ‘cithera’ was applied, there is no corresponding evidence that ‘citherator’ was used in Anglo-Latin to refer to players on other plucked string instruments, and 1476–7 would be quite early for the cithern and its vocabulary to have spread to England. The two remaining possibilities would appear to be either that the accountant was simply employing synonyms for variety or that players on two different types or shapes of harp are being distinguished.

               The warden of the Fleet Prison in 1490–1 was Richard Babyngton (TNA: PRO E 101/516/21); in 1498, William Babyngton (TNA: PRO Cal. Inq. p.m., xii, no. 28).

            <ab>In the Tudor and earlier periods, performing exotic animals (excluding bears) appear to have been patronized exclusively by royalty, particularly the monarch. This is borne out by a search of patronized performing animal troupes in REED’s <title>Patrons and Performances Web Site</title>. It is therefore probable that the leader of the marmoset and jennet (a small Spanish horse) who is paid at Furnival’s Inn in Christmas 1481–2 (p 17, ll.25–6) was patronized by Edward IV, and the keeper of the baboon (p 19, l.5) who is paid at the same Inn on Christmas Day 1485 was patronized by Henry VII (his newborn son, Arthur, prince of Wales, later patronized a baboon keeper who appears in New Romney, Kent, in 1494–5: see REED: <title>Kent: Diocese of Canterbury</title>, vol 2, p 753). It is probable the mention of ‘Lyons’ here (l.16) and the payments to ‘Pescod the keeper of the Lyons’ in 1497–8 (p 25, l.6) and to ‘Pescodde’ in 1498–9 (p 25, l.19) are all references to the king’s lion keeper. Henry VII’s lion keeper was paid at Shrewsbury in April 1493; his predecessors, Edward IV and Richard III, also kept lions that travelled outside of London.<lb/>
               Pescod seems to have been the keeper of at least one other kind of exotic animal, as attested by two entries from the Magdalen College Libri Computi not included in REED: <title>Oxford</title>. In 1494–5 (f 26), ‘Solut<ex>um</ex> Pescode seruanti quand<ex>am</ex> bestia<ex>m</ex> vocata<ex>m</ex> ly Mermusytt ex co<ex>n</ex>silio senior<ex>um</ex> q<ex>uia</ex> rex erat apud Woodstocke xij d.’ (‘12d paid to Pescod, keeping a beast called the marmoset, by the council of the seniors because the king was at Woodstock’). In 1495–6 (f 40), ‘Solut<ex>um</ex> pescod ducenti duo a<ex>n</ex>imalia nu<ex>n</ex>cupata Mermosettes in regard<ex>o</ex> viij d.’ (‘8d paid in reward to Pescod, leading two animals called marmosets’). That Henry VII kept marmosets is indicated by a payment to the king’s marmoset in Dover, Kent, in 1488–9: see REED: <title>Kent: Diocese of Canterbury</title>, vol 2, p 374. (Thanks to Mark Sorrell for drawing attention to the Magdalen College entries and for sharing his knowledge concerning patronage of exotic animals in early modern England.)</ab>

            <ab>J.H. Baker (ed), <title>The Reports of Sir John Spelman</title>, vol 1, Selden Society 93 (London, 1977), ix, notes that Sir John Spelman’s report about the Christmas revels held in Gray’s Inn ‘“in ancient temps” almost certainly belongs to his student days, and is the earliest detailed description of those curious rites.’ As Spelman entered Gray’s Inn about 1500 and as the composition date of his ‘Reports’ is unknown, we have assigned this report to c 1500. Of the vocal pieces mentioned in Spelman’s report, ‘what shall we singe in worshipe of this daie’ (p 27, ll.7–8), ‘ther shall none reigne downe reigne’ (p 27, ll.9–10), and ‘rounde abowt the fier’ (p 27, l.10) remain unidentified; ‘nescienz mate<ex>r</ex>’ (p 27, l.2) is the motet ‘Nesciens mater virgo virum’ by Jean Mouton (1459–1522). Baker, <title>Reports</title>, vol 1, p 234, identifies ‘fare well et have good daye’ (p 27, l.18) with an Epiphany carol found in Balliol College: MS 354 and printed in A.W. Pollard, <title>Fifteenth Century Prose and Verse</title> (Westminster, 1903), 89 – 90, as well as in Edith Rickert, <title>Ancient English Christmas Carols</title> (London and New York, 1914), 225–6, and Richard Leighton Greene (ed), <title>The Early English Christmas Carols</title>, 2nd ed (Oxford, 1977), 85.</ab>

            <ab>Bland, in ‘Fifteenth-Century Revels,’ p 265, n 1, identifies the ‘Ladie Princ<ex>es</ex>’ as Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. This is improbable: Margaret was married by proxy 15 January 1502/3 to James IV of Scotland, leaving for Edinburgh on 8 July 1503. She was formally married in Scotland on 8 August 1503. By Christmas 1503–4, therefore, she was the queen of Scotland and no longer a member of the English court. The princess being referred to here is Katherine of Arragon, dowager princess of Wales, who had been betrothed to Prince Henry on 25 June 1503. Unlike Margaret, Katherine (as princess) is known to have patronized performers between 1500–2 and in 1507. See REED’s <title>Patrons and Performances Web Site</title> for more information.</ab>

            <ab>This passage is cited nearly verbatim by Raphael Holinshed, <title>Chronicles of England</title>, vol 3 (London, 1587; STC : 13569), 894. An external reference to the ‘plaie at Grayes inne’ occurs in a letter from Archbishop William Warham to his chaplain Henry Gold, 6 February 1526/7 (see Appendix 4). The lost play, which has been called ‘Lord Governance and Lady Public Weal,’ has been the subject of much speculation (see Appendix 6.2). Apart from a play proposed by William Baldwin in or about 1555–6 (see p 80), it is the only Inns of Court play prior to <title>Gorboduc</title> (1561–2) whose subject is known.</ab>

            <ab>Foxe’s narrative continues with the story of Simon Fish’s <title>A Supplicacyon for the Beggers</title> (Antwerp?, 1529; STC: 10883). The Simon Fish affair is not recorded in earlier editions (STC: 11222–4). The letter of Archbishop William Warham (see preceding endnote) confirms the date of 1526–7.</ab>

            <ab>The gist of these entries is that the musicians received their payment this year not as a wage but as a gift, since it was decided not to keep ‘solempne Crystemas’ because of the ‘grette darth’ (f 161).</ab>
