            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
               establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
               contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
               and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
               communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
               closed the London theatres.</p>

               on teusday<note type="foot">16 February 1612/13</note> yt came to <orgName n="Gray's Inn">Grayes ynne</orgName> and the <orgName n="Inner Temple">inner Temple</orgName>s turne to come w<ex>i</ex>th theyre <title>maske</title>, wherof <persName n="Sir Francis Bacon">s<ex>i</ex>r Fra<ex>ncis</ex> Bacon</persName> was the cheife contriuer, and because the former came on horse backe, and open chariots, they made choise to come by water from <placeName n="Winchester Place">winchester place</placeName> in <placeName n="Southwark">Southwarke</placeName>: (w<ex>hi</ex>ch suted well enough w<ex>i</ex>th theyre deuise), w<ex>hi</ex>ch was the mariage of the riuer of Thames to the Rhine: and theyre shew by water was very gallant by reason of infinite store of lights very curiously set and placed: and many boats and barges w<ex>i</ex>th deuises of light and lampes, w<ex>i</ex>th three peales of ordinance, one at theyre taking water, another in the <placeName n="Temple Garden">Temple garden</placeName>, and the | last at theyre landing: w<ex>hi</ex>ch passage by water cost them better then <measure type="currency">three hundred pound</measure>. they were <del>by</del> receued at the priuie stayres: <del>but by</del> and great expectation theyre was that they should euery way exceed theyre competitors that went before them, both in deuise, daintines, of apparell, and aboue all in dauncing (wherin they are held excellent) and esteemed far the properer men but by what yll planet yt fell out I know not, they came home as they went w<ex>i</ex>thout dooing any thing, the reason wherof I cannot yet lerne thoroughly, <del>s</del> but only ^<add place="above">was</add> that the hall was so full that yt was not possible to auoyde yt or make roome for them, besides that most of the ladies were in the galleries to see them land, and could not get in. but the worst of all was that the <persName n="James I">king</persName> was so wearied and sleepie w<ex>i</ex>th sitting vp almost two whole nights before, that he had no edge to yt, wherupon <persName n="Sir Francis Bacon">S<ex>i</ex>r Fra<ex>ncis</ex> Bacon</persName> aduentured to intreat <persName n="James I">his maiestie</persName>, that by this disgrace he wold not as yt were bury them quicke: and I heare <persName n="James I">the king</persName> should aunswer, that then they must burie him quicke for he could last no longer, but w<ex>i</ex>th all gaue them very goode wordes and appointed them to come again on saterday<note type="foot">20 February 1612/13</note>: but the grace of theyre maske is quite gon when theyre apparell hath ben alredy shewed and theyre deuises vented. how yt will fall out God knowes, for they are much discouraged, and out of countenance, and the world sayes yt <del>sa</del> comes to passe after the old prouerb, the properer men the worse lucke. One thing I had almost forgotten for hast that all this time there was a course taken and so notified that no <persName type="woman">lady or gentlewoman</persName> should be admitted to any of these sights w<ex>i</ex>th a vardingale, w<ex>hi</ex>ch was to gaine the more roome, and I hope may serue to make them quite left of in time. <del><damage/>.</del>] and yet there were more scaffolds and more prouision made for roome then euer I saw both in the <placeName n="Whitehall">hall</placeName> and <placeName n="Banqueting House">banketting roome</placeName>. besides a new roome built to dine sup and daunce in.......
