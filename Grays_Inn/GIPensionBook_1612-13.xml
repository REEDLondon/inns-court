            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
               establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his
               contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe,
               and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other
               communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans
               closed the London theatres.</p>

            <mods:abstract>"Surviving Pension Books date from 1568–9. William Dugdale consulted an earlier volume, now lost. His Origines Juridiciales (1666) preserves entries from 1529–30 and 1550–1 (see pp 58–9, 74; see p lxxvi for document description). Financial accounts were entered in the Pension Book to 1582–3, and thereafter in Ledger Books. The library holds microfiche of the Pension Books produced in 1976 (skipping ff 234v–5), and digital photos of PEN/1/1 (Pension Book 1), taken in 2006 when the volume was disbound for conservation.
               The standard essential publication is Reginald J. Fletcher (ed), The Pension Book of Gray’s Inn (Records of the Honourable Society)1569–1669, vol 1 (London, 1901)."</mods:abstract>
