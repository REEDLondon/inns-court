# Guiding Principles

REED London Online aims to develop and support work based on best practice for digital scholarly editing, as well as guiding principles laid out by colleagues, peers, and projects that have come before us. 

We adhere strictly to the TEI guidelines: http://tei-c.org and are developing our approach to ontology creation based on the work done by the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory - http://sparql.cwrc.ca/, and by extension the W3C standards for RDF and LOD.

Some works that continue to be helpful in guiding our work:
* Cummings, James. "A World of Difference: Myths and Misconceptions about the TEI. _Digital Scholarship in the Humanities_. 2018. doi:10.1093/llc/fqy071
* Jakacki, Diane. "" in _Janelle's book_
* Brown, Susan ... 
* The Endings Project.
