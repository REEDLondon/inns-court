            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is
               establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and
               his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate,
               transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular
               music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642,
               when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

            <mods:abstract>John Chamberlain (1553-1628) was a professional letter-writer employed by
               contemporaries who preserved his letters in considerable numbers. Chief among his
               employers was Sir Dudley Carlteton (1574-1632), Viscount Dorchester, a career
               diplomat who served in Venice from 1610 to 1615. (Carleton was admitted to Gray's Inn
               in 1605). Carleton's sister Alice was a favourite of Chamberlain. This letter, dated
               18 February 1612/13, describes the performance events staged for the wedding of
               Princess Elizabeth to Frederick, Elector Palatine.</mods:abstract>

                     Bacon</persName> was the cheife contriuer, and because the former came on horse
                  backe, and open chariots, they made choise to come by water from
                     <placeName>winchester place</placeName> in <placeName>Southwarke</placeName>:
                     (w<ex>hi</ex>ch suted well enough w<ex>i</ex>th theyre deuise), w<ex>hi</ex>ch
                  was the mariage of the riuer of Thames to the Rhine: and theyre shew by water was
                  very gallant by reason of infinite store of lights very curiously set and placed:
                  and many boats and barges w<ex>i</ex>th deuises of light and lampes, w<ex>i</ex>th
                  three peales of ordinance, one at theyre taking water, another in the

                  way exceed theyre competitors that went before them, both in deuise, daintines, of
                  apparell, and aboue all in dauncing (wherin they are held excellent) and esteemed
                  far the properer men but by what yll planet yt fell out I know not, they came home
                  as they went w<ex>i</ex>thout dooing any thing, the reason wherof I cannot yet
                  lerne thoroughly, <del>s</del> but only <add place="above">was</add> that the hall
                  was so full that yt was not possible to auoyde yt or make roome for them, besides
                  that most of the ladies were in the galleries to see them land, and could not get
                  in. but the worst of all was that the <persName>king</persName> was so wearied and
                  sleepie w<ex>i</ex>th sitting vp almost two whole nights before, that he had no
                  edge to yt, wherupon <persName>S<ex>i</ex>r Fra<ex>ncis</ex> Bacon</persName>
                  aduentured to intreat <persName>his maiestie</persName>, that by this disgrace he
                  wold not as yt were bury them quicke: and I heare <persName>the king</persName>
                  should aunswer, that then they must burie him quicke for he could last no longer,
                  but w<ex>i</ex>th all gaue them very goode wordes and appointed them to come again

                  hast that all this time there was a course taken and so notified that no lady or
                  gentlewoman should be admitted to any of these sights w<ex>i</ex>th a vardingale,
