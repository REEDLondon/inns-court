            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that
               is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of
               Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since
               then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of
               drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the
               Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>
            <p>REED London Online is a prototype online collection developing from the Records of Early English Drama (REED) in partnership with the Canadian Writing Research Collaboratory (CWRC) and supported by Bucknell University. It aims to establish an openly accessible online scholarly and pedagogical resource of London-centric documentary, editorial, and bibliographic materials related to performance, theatre, and music spanning the period 1100-1642. With support from an NHPRC-Mellon Planning Grant for Digital Edition Publishing Cooperatives and CANARIE Research Software Program grants, REED London is creating new environments for scholarly presentation of archival materials gathered from legal, ecclesiastical, civic, political, and personal archival sources in and around London. The objective of the REED London project team is to build a stable, extensible publication environment that optimizes access to these compiled materials in ways that respond to scholars’ research interests across disciplines. Consulting with other planning grant recipients will be invaluable to ensuring that REED London’s production and publication environment is in line with standards laid out in the NHPRC-Mellon grant objectives. It is hoped that the progress REED London and CWRC make will also inform the larger dialogue about best practices among funded teams.</p>

               </head>

               <p>Life at the Inns of Court, whether devoted to the practice of
                  law, the study of law, or secular entertainment, was largely governed by the legal
                  year, divided into four terms defined by the liturgical calendar: Michaelmas (from
                  29 September), Hilary (from 13 January), Easter (springtime – moveable), and
                  Trinity (summertime – moveable). [10. Information in this
                     section relies heavily on Finkelpearl, John Marston of the Middle
                        Temple, Chapters 3 and 4; and Baker, 'Christmas in the Inns
                        of Court and Chancery,' pp 41-7.] Secular entertainment was
                  associated with Michaelmas and Hilary terms, and even more particularly with the
                  breaks or vacations between terms over the Christmas season, which by common
                  agreement began on 1 November (All Saints’ Day) and ended on 2 February
                  (Candlemas) or Shrovetide (the three days before Ash Wednesday).</p>

               <p>The report of the c 1534–47 royal commission confirms the
                  connection between Christmas and entertainment (see p 62): <quote>The Readers and
                     Benchers at a Parliament or Pension held before Christmas, if it seeme unto
                     them that there be no dangerous time of sickness, neither dearth of victuals,
                     and that they are furnished of such a Company, as both for their number and
                     appertaines are meet to keep a solemn Christmas, then doe they appoint and
                     chose certain of the house to be Officers, and bear certain rules in the house
                     during the said time, which Officers for the most part are such, as are
                     exercised in the King’s Highness house, and other Noble men, and this is done
                     onely to the intent, that they should in time to come know how to use
                     themselves. In this Christmas time, they have all manner of pastimes, as
                     singing and dancing; and in some of the houses ordinarily they have some
                     interlude or Tragedy played by the Gentlemen of the same house, the ground, and
                     matter whereof, is devised by some of the Gentlemen of the house.</quote> Thus
                  for the entertainment to go forward, plague or other danger must be absent, while
                  willing and able personnel must be on hand. Christmas ‘pastimes’ included singing
                  and dancing, and sometimes plays. The range of activities is verified and even
                  extended for the fifteenth century by an antiquarian history of
                     Clifford’s Inn (an Inn of Chancery, c
                  1483 (22 Edward IV), naming ‘Choyce musicke, maiesticall
                  maskes, stately stageplaye!." bountifull Banquettings, dycing, daunceinge, and
                  many other rare invented Courtlyke pastymes, with like Raritye, of Oratory
                  Speeches’ (see p 350). The ostensible purpose of the entertainments, including
                  appointments to supervisory offices, was according to the report of c 1534–47 to prepare gentlemen for life at court.</p>

               <p>Christmas at the Inns of Court was generally celebrated in
                  either a conventional or a more ‘solemn,’ intensive manner. A conventional
                  Christmas was presided over by a master of the revels who was typically appointed
                  in November. The revels which he supervised consisted primarily of feasting,
                  music, dancing, and gaming, especially on the three or four Saturdays leading up
                  to Christmas, and on major post-Christmas holidays such as Holy Innocents’ Day (28
                  December), New Year’s Day, Twelfth Night (6 January), and Candlemas. Less
                  frequently a lord of misrule or Christmas prince presided over a more elaborate
                  and scripted Christmas season, often at enormous cost to himself and others. </p>

               <p>A printed satire of 1601 acknowledges the importance of ‘Revels’ to the
                     Inns of Court: ‘You kept such reuell with your carelesse
                  pen,/ As made me thinke you of the Innes of Court:/ For they vse Reuels more then
                  any men.’ [11. W.I., The Whipping of the
                        Satire (London, 1601; STC: 14071), sig E9v. The author may be John
                     Weever.] At Furnival’s Inn ‘Revellors’ received bread
                  in 1407–8, while in 1416–17 and 1417–18 lists of food are headed ‘fforreyn
                     <expan>Expenc<ex>es</ex></expan> touchinge the Revells’ and ‘<expan>Expenc<ex>e</ex>s</expan> circa le
                  Revells.’ The first mention of revels at Lincoln’s Inn occurs
                  in a decree of 1430–1 that ‘ther schal be iiij revels in the yeere and no mo’ –
                  suggesting that revels had become frequent in the recent past. </p>

               <p>The appointment of a master of the revels is recorded annually (except for plague
                  years) at Lincoln’s Inn from 1455–6, at the Middle
                     Temple from 1501–2, and at the Inner Temple from
                  1505–6. A notable incumbent at Lincoln’s Inn was the poet
                     John Donne, who (as ‘mr dun’) held the office in 1592–3.
                  Systematic appointments cease at the Inner Temple in 1554–5 and
                  at the Middle Temple in 1558–9, but continue at
                     Lincoln’s Inn through 1617–18. (No comparable sequence
                  survives from Gray’s Inn.) The Records disclose that
                  appointments continued even when they were not systematically recorded. At the
                  Middle Temple a ‘mr Watson’ was ‘Lord of Misrule’ in 1613–14, Bulstrode
                     Whitelocke was master of the revels in 1628–9, and Thomas
                     Maunsell held the same office in 1635–6. Thanks to Whitelocke’s
                  penchant for autobiography we have a lengthy and highly informative account of his
                  tenure. An unidentified gentleman was appointed master of the revels at Lincoln’s
                  Inn for 1629–30, while Thomas Escourt held the office in 1633–4. At
                     Gray’s Inn John Lambert held the office in 1594–5 (Jarvis
                  Tevery was ‘Master of the Revellers’), while in 1640–1 a Mr Henry Parker was
                  appointed master of the revels in the place of Edward Page. </p>

               <p>Titles other than ‘Lord of Misrule’ or ‘Master of the Revels’ sometimes occur in
                  contexts which suggest a distinction without much of a difference. At the
                     Middle Temple a ‘lord of Candlemas night’ is named in 1590–1
                  (see p 118 and endnote, which point back to 1584), while a ‘Lieutenant’ of
                  Christmas was appointed at various Inns during the seventeenth century, including
                     Lincoln’s Inn in 1617–18 (‘<expan>Lo<ex>rd</ex></expan> Lieutenant
                  generall’), the Middle Temple in 1622–3, and the Inner
                     Temple in 1624–5, 1627–8, and 1628–9. </p>

               <p>The master of the revels was only one of many Christmas officers. In 1553–4, for
                  example, the Inner Temple recognized seven offices: constable
                  marshal, sergeants of the queen, common sergeants, masters of the revels, master
                  of the game, the ranger, and attendant of the tower. [12.
                     Inderwick, Calendar, vol 1, p 175.] In the same year the
                     Middle Temple appointed five officers: steward, marshal,
                  constable, butler, and master of the revels. [13. Hopwood,
                        Middle Temple Records, vol 1, p 94.] Dugdale
                  transcribes an elaborate list from the Inner Temple 1561–2
                  (Appendix 11, p 769). Most masters of the revels cited in the Records are
                  extracted from such lists. </p>

               <p>As the mastership of the revels entailed a considerable financial burden,
                  prospective members of an Inn sometimes insisted on exemption from the office as a
                  condition of admission, as with John Newdigate of Lincoln’s
                  Inn, 1509–10. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century five or
                  six candidates were routinely appointed in the expectation of finding one who
                  would serve. Gerard Legh’s Accedens of Armory, referring to the
                     Inner Temple, 1561–2, mentions ‘.iiii. Masters of the
                  Reuelles’ as if this were the approved number (Appendix 1, p 372, ll.1–2). Members
                  refused the office in such numbers that their fines served as a source of general
                  funding. </p>

               <p>Bulstrode Whitelocke, master of the revels at the Middle Temple
                  in 1628–9, confirms that revels were celebrated on successive Saturday nights
                  during the Christmas season (see p 224, l.15). (A Saturday tradition is reported
                  as early as 1471–2 at Furnival’s Inn and 1529–30 at Gray’s
                  Inn.) Satisfactory discharge of responsibilities required both planning
                  and diligent practice (see pp 223–4): <quote>When they met att the Tauerne their
                     buisnes was, to practise their dauncing, &amp; to exercise both their wits
                     &amp; bodyes, &amp; not to clowde their reason, or parts with excesse or
                     debauchery, butt to improue their judgements &amp; knowledge, by good discourse
                     &amp; conuersation, &amp; sometimes by putting of cases, &amp; they did appear
                     togither, much more like to graue antients in a Councell chamber, then to young
                     reuellers in an house of drinking.</quote>
               </p>

               <p>In 1629–30 the musician Henry Wilson received 20s from the Middle
                     Temple ‘for 2 nightes practice of the <expan>gent<ex>lemen</ex></expan> Revellers’;
                  similarly in 1632–3 the musician Geoffrey Collins received 10s ‘for our paines in
                  the hall <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> the Revellers one <expan>night<ex>es</ex></expan> practice.’ The more
                  powerful office of Christmas prince or ‘king’ is described c 1500 by Sir John Spelman. Translated from obscure law-French into
                  modern English, ‘The rules used in olden days in Gray’s Inn at
                  the time of the Nativity of our saviour Jesus Christ’ include the following:
                     <quote>...someone is chosen king by the clerks of the third table, and he shall
                     sit in the middle of the high bench and shall choose the officers, who were
                     previously ordained by the fellowship at the Cupboard. And then the wardens of
                     the wax shall take the torches, and the cupbearer and the carver shall give
                     bread and ale to the king. And then the king shall rise and all shall shout
                     with one voice, ‘Long live the king.’</quote>
               </p>

               <p>A ‘Kyng de Cokkeneys’ is recorded at Lincoln’s Inn in 1494–5
                  while ‘Iake Stray’ (Jack Straw) is mentioned in 1516–17. In 1518–19 both a ‘Kynge’
                  who ruled over Christmas Day and a ‘Kynge of Cockneys’ who ruled over Childermas
                  Day (Holy Innocents’ Day) were tolerated on good behaviour, whereas ‘Iack Strawe
                  &amp; all his adherentes’ were ‘ffrom hensforth uttrely banyshed.’ </p>

               <p> Under Elizabeth I and the Stuarts Christmas princes were few and far between.
                  Only seven incumbents have been identified between 1561–2 and 1641–2, and two more
                  for years after 1660:</p>

               <p> While the Gray’s Inn Prince of Purpoole (from the local site
                  name ‘Portpoole’) and the Middle Temple Prince d’Amour are
                  attested over the years, the Inner Temple Prince of Sophy and
                     Lincoln’s Inn Prince de la Grange are attested only in the
                  year listed. (Whether Edward Smyth held the latter title is unknown, but he and
                  John Lort held the designation ‘lord lieutenant’ in common.) The name
                  ‘Pallaphilos’ is applied to the Inner Temple prince in Gerard
                  Legh’s Accedens of Armory (1561–2), while the 1565/6
                     ‘Montagu Oration’ of Thomas Pounde of Lincoln’s
                     Inn declares, ‘<expan>o<ex>ur</ex></expan> prynce is the graund troposonte/ so named
                  longe ago’ (Appendix 3, p 626, ll.26–7).[14. Gerard’s
                     narrative reads, ‘The mightye Pallaphilos prince of Sophie’ (Appendix 1, p 372,
                     l.23), yet ‘Pallaphilos’ is identified in the same text as the
                  herald.]</p>

               <p>The relative prominence of just two Christmas princes, from Gray’s
                     Inn and the Middle Temple, may be related to the
                  fact that the Inns of Court paired up for major festivities,
                     Gray’s Inn with the Inner
                     Temple, Lincoln’s Inn with the
                     Middle Temple. Seasons in which this pairing is particularly
                  notable included 1594–5 (Gesta Grayorum), 1597–8 (Le Prince
                     d’Amour alias Noctes Templariae), and 1612/13 (when the four Inns
                  paired off to put on masques). [15. In Gesta
                        Grayorum the Inner Temple is ‘our ancient allied Friend’ (Appendix
                     1, p 382, l.8). Similarly Lincoln’s Inn is named in Le Prince d’Amour
                        alias Noctes Templariae (Appendix 1, p 479, l.8): hence the ‘show’
                     named in Lincoln’s Inn accounts for 1597–8. The pairing in 1612–13 is recorded
                     in the titles of the two masques of that year: see especially Appendix
                     6.1.]</p>

               <p>The long memory of the Inns of Court gentlemen is evident in
                  the fact that Henry Yelverton at Gray’s Inn (1617–18) was
                  styled Henry the second, in deference to Henry Helmes of 1594–5, and Richard
                  Vyvyan at the Middle Temple (1635–6) was styled Richard the
                  second, in deference to Richard Martyn of 1597–8.</p>

               <p>Christmas princes incurred vastly greater expenses than masters of the revels.
                  Richard Vyvyan is variously reported to have spent £3,000 or £6,000 of his recent
                  inheritance as Prince d’Amour of the Middle Temple. In Stuart
                  times (if not before) service as master of the revels was rewarded with a real
                  knighthood, as happened with Henry Yelverton and Richard Vyvyan. Thomas Dayrell of
                     Lincoln’s Inn, appointed ‘Marshall’ for The Triumph
                     of Peace, received his knighthood in February 1633/4.[16. The knighthoods are recorded in Wm. A. Shaw, The
                        Knights of England, vol 2 (London, 1906), 167 (Henry Yelverton, 23
                     February 1617/18), 202 (Thomas Dayrell, 4 February 1633/4), and 204 (Richard
                     Vyvyan, 1 March 1635/6).]</p>

               <p>While masters of the revels presided over Christmas feasting, music, dancing, and
                  gambling, Christmas princes presided over entertainments and rituals which
                  required elaborate planning, fund-raising, the appointment of additional officers,
                  and a script. Gerard Legh’s Accedens of Armory (Appendix 1, pp
                  371–2) preserves a long list of Inner Temple Christmas officers
                  for 1561–2, while Gesta Grayorum names almost fifty for 1594–5
                  (Appendix 1, pp 383–5). Inner Temple receipts for 1633–4 reveal
                  that eleven gentlemen purchased mock Christmas offices: thus Richard Brownlow paid
                  £5 for ‘his Office of Cheiffe Prothonotary of the <expan>Com<ex>m</ex>on</expan> pleas,’ while
                  Humphrey Streete paid £3 6s 8d for ‘his Office of Auditor.’ Of Richard Vyvyan of
                  the Middle Temple it was reported in 1635–6: ‘He hath all his
                  Greate officers attending him, <expan>L<ex>or</ex>d</expan> Keeper, <expan>L<ex>or</ex>d</expan> Treasorer,
                  eight whyte staues at the least, <expan>Cap<ex>tayne</ex></expan> of his Pencioners, Captayne of
                  his Guard, two Chaplaines’ (Appendix 4, p 708, ll.25–7; see also Appendix 1, pp
                  499–500).</p>

               <p>Six Christmas prince scripts which survive either complete or as fragments are
                  gathered into Appendix 1, ranging from Gerard Legh’s Accedens of
                     Armory in 1561–2 to the Middle Temple Christmas revels of 1635–6. The
                  most elaborate script, from Gray’s Inn 1594–5, was published in
                  1688 as Gesta Grayorum. Supplemented by Gray’s
                     Inn archival documents (see pp 121–5) this text records the full
                  range of events presided over by the Prince of Purpoole, including mock
                  proclamations and appointments, the reception of mock ambassadors, a play
                     (Comedy of Errors), masques, speeches, music, and dancing.</p>

               </head>

               <p>The royal commission report of c 1534–47 acknowledges the
                  tradition of ‘some interlude or Tragedy played by the Gentlemen of the same house,
                  the ground, and matter whereof, is devised by some of the Gentlemen of the house.’
                  An entertainment presented by ‘master Roo’ of Gray’s Inn,
                  1526–7, called both a ‘plaie’ and a ‘disguisyng,’ was perhaps a dramatic satire in
                  the Skeltonic tradition. In 1550–1 the governors of the same Inn proclaimed that
                  ‘when there shall be any ... Comedies, then all the Society at that time in
                  Commons, to bear the charge of the Apparel.’ About 1555–6 William Baldwin
                  consulted various Inns of Court concerning a play of his own
                  devising (see p 80), but nothing is known of an actual performance.</p>

               <p> In January 1561/2 the well-documented tragedy Gorboduc, otherwise
                  known as Ferrex and Porrex, was performed by the Inner
                     Temple, both at home and at court. Not only was this ‘Tragedy played
                  by the Gentlemen of the same house,’ but its ‘ground, and manner’ were literally
                  devised by gentlemen of the house,’ that is, by Thomas Sackville and Thomas Norton
                  (Appendix 6.1). Three more Inns of Court tragedies followed:
                  George Gascoigne’s Jocasta at Gray’s Inn,
                  Christmas season, 1566–7; the effectively anonymous Gismond of
                     Salerne at the Inner Temple in 1565–6 or 1566–7; and
                  Thomas Hughes’ Misfortunes of Arthur at Gray’s
                     Inn in January or February 1587/8. Inns of Court
                  comedy is represented uniquely by Gascoigne’s Supposes, performed
                  at Gray’s Inn in 1566–7. A lost play, evidently a Roman comedy,
                  is recorded at Gray’s Inn in 1587/8, but only a tantalizing
                  cast list survives and no evidence as to its composition (Appendix 7).</p>

               <p>
                  Gorboduc had a significant afterlife in print and was famously
                  commended by Sir Philip Sidney, but only Supposes is known to have
                  had an afterlife in performance, with a revival at Trinity College, Oxford, on 8
                  January 1581/2. [17. Sir Philip
                           Sidney, An Apologie for Poetrie (London,
                     1595; STC: 22534), sigs I4v–K1; and REED: Oxford, vol 2, p

               <p>As Wilfrid Prest observes, ‘after a brief but highly creative burst of dramatic
                  activity in the 1560s, the societies seem to have relied entirely upon
                  professionals; the only indigenous play known to have been performed between 1568
                  and 1640 was Thomas Hughes’ Misfortunes of Arthur....’ [18. Prest, Inns of Court, p 155. While Prest
                     dates this play to 1589, the present editors date it to 1587/8.] (We may
                  add the lost Roman comedy of the same year, 1587/8.) Even before the 1560s,
                  entertainers were given financial rewards by various Inns. At Furnival’s Inn
                  Thomas Thwaits paid 6s 8d in 1412–13 ‘pro Interludio,’ while in 1416–17 the Inn’s
                  treasurer paid 7s ‘Pro Lusoribus &amp; Ludo suo.’ An account of 1417–18
                  contains an entry ‘Pro Cœna Ludensium,’ apparently in connection with revels. In
                  1499–1500 Lincoln’s Inn paid 10s ‘<expan>p<ex>ro</ex></expan>
                  <expan>int<ex>er</ex>ludio</expan>’ on the feast of the Purification (2 February). Miscellaneous
                  entertainers recorded for Furnival’s Inn include the keepers of a monkey
                  (‘Marmosett,’ 1481–2; ‘Babone,’ 1485–6) and a lion (1497–8). The lion keeper,
                  whose name was Pescod, also visited Lincoln’s Inn (1498–9).
                  Even within the 1560s, the children of the Chapel, an outside if not perhaps a
                  fully professional company, played at Lincoln’s Inn under the
                  direction of Richard Edwards in 1564–5 and 1565–6; they returned under the
                  direction of Richard Farrant in 1579–80.</p>

               <p>All Inns of Court plays subsequent to 1587–8 seem indeed to
                  have been performed by professionals, including Shakespeare’s Comedy of
                     Errors, given at Gray’s Inn on 28 December 1594;
                  unnamed comedies at the Middle Temple on 28 December 1597 and 2
                  January 1597/8; and Shakespeare’s Twelfth Night, given at the
                     Middle Temple on 2 February 1601/2 Candlemas). (The
                     Gesta Grayorum, Appendix 1, p 397, l.38, denigrates the
                  professional players as ‘a Company of base and common Fellows’ who had been
                  ‘foisted’ on the distinguished gentlemen of Gray’s Inn.)</p>

               <p> While a Candlemas play seems to be indicated by a Gray’s Inn
                  entry of 1579–80, the earliest explicit reference to a standing tradition of
                     Inns of Court plays on All Saints and Candlemas occurs in an
                     Inner Temple prohibition of 1610–11, labelled ‘Noe playes
                  one festyvall days’:</p>

               <p>And for that great disorder &amp; scurrilytie is brought into this howse by
                  lewde &amp; lasciuious playes. It is likewise ordered in this
                     <expan>p<ex>ar</ex>liam<ex>en</ex>t</expan> that from henceforth there shalbe no more playes
                  in this howse either vpon the ffeast of all <expan>S<ex>ain</ex>ct<ex>e</ex>s</expan> or
                  Candlemas day, but the same from henceforth to bee vtterly taken awaie and
                  abolyshed...</p>

               <p>Verification survives in a 1611–12 reversal of the same order, where ‘of late
                  yeares vpon the two festivall dayes of All <expan>S<ex>ain</ex>t<ex>e</ex>s</expan> and
                  Candlemasse playes haue beene vsed after dinner for recreacion w<ex>hi</ex>ch haue
                  lately beene layd downe by order in Parliament It is now ordered that the same
                  order shall henceforth stand repealed.’ An implicit reference to the tradition
                  occurs as early as 1605–6 (Lincoln’s Inn). Absolute and
                  detailed verification occurs in a Middle Temple receipt in the
                  hand of the professional actor Edward Juby, dated 2 February 1615/16: ‘Receved of
                  Mr Baldwin, for a play parformd by the Palgraves Players, on Candlmas day last
                  1615 the Sume of twelue poundes.’ A similar receipt, also from the Middle
                     Temple, dated 3 November 1632 and signed by Anthony Turner, even
                  preserves a play title: ‘<expan>Rec<ex>eived</ex></expan> then of the Society of the
                        <expan>Midd<ex>le</ex></expan> Temple <expan>Lond<ex>on</ex></expan> for a Playe called
                  Hyde Parke, acted there on the feast of all S<ex>ain</ex>t<ex>e</ex>s last past
                  the <expan>sum<ex>m</ex>e</expan> of Ten poundes....’ Hyde Park was a comedy by
                  James Shirley, licensed 20 April 1632 and printed in 1637 (see Appendix 6.3). [19. Bentley, Jacobean and Caroline Stage, vol
                     5, p 1122.]</p>

               <p> In addition to Hyde Park, Comedy of Errors, and
                     Twelfth Night, whose texts survive, the Records and
                  supplementary documents preserve the titles of three professional plays whose
                  texts are lost: ‘Oxford Tragedy,’ ‘The Bridegroom and the
                     Madman,’ and ‘The City Shuffler,’ performed respectively
                  on All Saints or Candlemas 1607/8, 1618/19, and 1633–4. Named companies appearing
                  at various Inns of Court from 1614–15 to the 1640s include the
                  king’s men alias Blackfriars’ players, the palsgrave’s men, Prince Charles’ men,
                  the queen’s men, and Beeston’s boys (see REED’s Patrons and Performances
                     Web Site). On All Saints’ Day 1611–12 the Inner
                     Temple hosted, instead of plays and players, ‘<expan>Antick<ex>e</ex>s</expan> or
                     <expan>puppitt<ex>e</ex>s</expan>.’ Certain roles in the Inner Temple Masque of
                  1618/19 were played by named members of Prince Charles’ company, though the
                  printed text also reports that the masque itself received ‘it’s Illustration from
                  nine of the Gentlemen of the House’ (Appendix 2, p 581, ll.2–6, 24–5).</p>

               <p> Records concerning professional performers and performances have implications not
                  only for the Inns of Court, but also for the professional
                  companies. Taking the king’s men as the most fully documented example, it appears
                  that the players committed to being in London (and not on the road) on 1 November
                  and 2 February each and every year from perhaps the beginning of the seventeenth
                  century to the closing of the theatres in 1642.</p>

                  fits these Inns of Court entertainments: ‘A form of courtly dramatic
                  entertainment, often richly symbolic, in which music and dancing played a
                  substantial part, costumes and stage machinery tended to be elaborate, and the
                  audience might be invited to contribute to the action or the dancing.’ The
                  definition continues with an equally applicable historical narrative: ‘The masque
                  became a clearly defined genre during the reigns of James i and Charles i; less
                  sophisticated earlier spectacles are sometimes called entertainments to distinguish them from these Stuart masques....’ At
                  least one contemporary took the word ‘masque’ more literally: John Chamberlain
                  (see his letters in Appendix 4) objected that the Gray’s Inn
                  entertainment of 19 February 1617/18 (The Masque of Mountebanks)
                  was at best a ‘shew’: ‘for I cannot call yt a maske seeing they were not disguised
                  nor had visards.’ Earlier, on 23 February 1612/13, Chamberlain had complained in a
                  somewhat similar vein that a certain masque (not by the Inns of
                     Court) ‘was long and tedious, and <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> many deuises more
                  lyke a play then a maske’; he commended the joint masque of Lincoln’s
                     Inn and the Middle Temple, presumably because it
                  better fit his idea of what a masque should be.</p>

               <p>Pre-Elizabethan entertainments at the Inns of Court, generally
                  identified as disguisings, may have featured masque-like spectacle as well as
                  plot. On 3 January 1489/90 an Inner Temple disguising ‘went to
                  grays Inne’; a week later a Gray’s Inn disguising ‘cam
                     <expan>i<ex>n</ex></expan> lyke wise to ye <expan>Inn<ex>er</ex></expan> <expan>Te<ex>m</ex>ple</expan>.’
                  On the penultimate day of January the Inner Temple possibly
                  played its disguising at home before the earls of Oxford, Derby, and Shrewsbury;
                  Lord Hastings; the lord chamberlain (Sir William Stanley); sixteen or seventeen
                  knights; and various squires and gentlemen. In 1503–4 Lincoln’s
                     Inn paid 10s to the king’s minstrels ‘for the dysguysyng.’ A
                        Lincoln’s Inn entry for 1529–30
                  concerns a disguising of that year. In 1533–4 the Inns of Court
                  kept Christmas with ‘suche <expan>disguysing<ex>es</ex></expan> and pastymes as hath not byn
                  sene’ (Appendix 4, p 683).</p>

               <p>Even Inns of Court plays tended to be long on spectacle. The
                     Inner Temple tragedy Gorboduc
                  (1561–2) featured elaborate dumb shows. The masque-like qualities of The
                     Misfortunes of Arthur (1587/8) are announced on its title page: ‘Certaine deuises and shewes presented to her Maiestie by the
                     gentlemen of Grayes-Inne at her Highnesse court in Greenewich.’ Though
                  neither of these was a fully developed masque, both belonged to the entertainment
                  tradition out of which the formal masque would develop.</p>

               <p>The Gray’s Inn ‘Masque of Juno and Diana’
                  (1564/5) was characterized by elaborate scenic effects, with contributions by the
                  office of the Revels (Appendix 5). The Gesta Grayorum of 1594/5 is
                  described on the title page of its late first edition (1688) as having been
                  performed with a masque. The masque in question was The Masque of
                     Proteus (see Appendix 6.1). Stephen Orgel characterizes this masque,
                  evidently by Francis Davison, as ‘the first English masque to conceive, in however
                  small a way, of the masquing hall as a theater.’ [20. Stephen
                     Orgel, The Jonsonian Masque (Cambridge, MA, 1965), 9.]
                  Francis Bacon alludes, in a letter of c 1595–6, to a failed
                  ‘joynt maske from the fowr Innes of Cowrt.’</p>

               <p>Eight post-Elizabethan Inns of Court masques are more or less
                  richly documented in the Records and Appendixes 2, 4, 5, and 6.1 (under
                  ‘Masques’): The Memorable Masque (by Chapman), Middle
                     Temple and Lincoln’s Inn, 15 February 1612/13;
                     Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray’s
                        Inn (by Beaumont), 20 February 1612/13; Masque of
                     Flowers (anonymous), Gray’s Inn, 6 January 1613/14;
                  Ulysses and Circe (by William Browne of Tavistock), Inner
                     Temple, 13 January 1614/15; Masque of Mountebanks
                  (anonymous), Gray’s Inn, 2 and 19 February 1617/18; The
                     Masque of Heroes (by Middleton), Inner Temple,
                  between 6 January and 2 February 1618/19; Triumph of Peace (by
                  Shirley), Four Inns, 3 and 13 February 1633/4; and Triumphs of the Prince
                     d’Amour (by Davenant), Middle Temple, 23 or 24
                  February 1635/6. (Yet more masques noted in Appendix 8 might logically be added to
                  this list.) The genre seems to have received its impetus from the 14 February
                  1612/13 wedding of Princess Elizabeth, notorious for her love of masques and
                  plays. Most Inns of Court masque texts were commis- sioned from
                  professional dramatists, and most were put into print and advertised for sale by
                  publishers with shops in or near the legal district (see the title pages
                  transcribed in Appendix 2).</p>

               <p> Masques sometimes entailed a mix of amateur and professional players. In 1612–13
                  stockings were purchased by Lincoln’s Inn for
                     ‘<expan>Heming<ex>es</ex></expan> boy,’ probably William, son of John Heminges of the king’s
                  men, probably in connection with the masque performed jointly with the
                     Middle Temple. We have already noted that the
                        Inner Temple Masque of 1618/19 was played
                  by professionals as well as by ‘the Gentlemen of the House.’</p>

               <p> While most Inns of Court masques, like plays and shows before them, were
                  organized with royalty or nobility in mind, The Triumph of Peace of
                  February 1633/4 was explicitly political. In 1633 the incautious William Prynne,
                  of Lincoln’s Inn, published a book whose subject is effusively
                  proclaimed in its title (STC: 20464): <quote>Histrio-mastix The players scourge, or, actors tragædie, divided into two
                        parts. Wherein it is largely evidenced ... That popular Stage-playes ... are
                        sinfull, heathenish, lewde, ungodly Spectacles, and most pernicious
                        Corruptions; condemned in all ages, as intolerable Mischiefes to Churches,
                        to Republickes, to the manners, mindes, and soules of men. And that the
                        Profession of Play-poets, of Stage-players; together with the penning,
                        acting, and frequenting of Stage-playes, are unlawfull, infamous and
                        misbeseeming Christians. All pretences to the contrary are here likewise
                        fully answered; and the unlawfulnes of acting, of beholding Academicall
                        Enterludes, briefly discussed; besides sundry other particulars concerning
                        Dancing, Dicing, Health-drinking, &amp;c. of which the Table will
                        informe you.</quote> Prynne dedicated his screed to the benchers of
                     Lincoln’s Inn. Adding to their discomfort, in his Index
                  Prynne referenced court masques, in which Queen Henrietta Maria and various
                  noblewomen were frequent participants: ‘Women-Actors, notorious whores.’</p>

               <p>All four Inns joined in a theatrical frenzy meant to reassure the king and queen
                  of their institutional sympathy and loyalty. Committees were appointed, money was
                  raised, and a playwright was hired. This was James Shirley, resident of the parish
                  of St Andrew, Holborn, and thus a neighbour of Gray’s Inn,
                  formally admitted as ‘one of the Valets of the Chamber of Queen Henrietta
                     Maria.’ [21. See <hi rend="italic">ODNB</hi> under ‘James
                     Shirley.’] Shirley himself describes his Triumph of Peace
                  as ‘for the variety of the Shewes, and richnesse of the Habits, the most
                  magnificent that hath beene brought to Court in our time’ (Appendix 2, p 612).
                  Inigo Jones was hired as manager and designer, William Lawes and Simon Ives to
                  compose the music. The enormous cost of the enterprise – said to have been in
                  excess of £20,000 – burdened all four Inns for years to come.</p>

               <p>The financial burden on the Middle Temple was compounded by its
                  decision to mount yet another masque two years later. This was William Davenant’s
                     Triumphs of the Prince d’Amour, performed on 23 or 24 February
                  1635/6. For the first time, rather than bringing the masque to the royal court,
                  royalty came to the Inn, including the prince elector and his brother Prince
                  Rupert. Though the king did not attend, Queen Henrietta Maria appeared with ladies
                  of her court, all wearing hats to preserve the fiction of being ‘in disguise.’
                  Gervase Holles reports that the masque cost the Middle Temple
                  ‘neare .20000. li. Sterling’ (Appendix 4, p 708).</p>

                  <title> Orations</title>
               </head>

               <p> In Thomas Dekker’s Satiromastix (London, 1602; STC: 6521, sig M1) Sir Rees ap Vaughan admonishes his fellow character Horace,
                  generally held to represent Ben Jonson: ‘You shall sweare not to bumbast out a new
                  Play, with the olde lynings of Iestes, stolne from the Temples Reuels.’ (‘Iestes’
                  may be a pun on both ‘chests’ and ‘jests.’) While Dekker may have been thinking of
                  Inner or Middle Temple plays or masques, perhaps he had also in
                  mind various comic or semi-serious paradoxes and orations which passed for
                  entertainment at the Inns of Court.</p>

               <p>The distinction between masques and plays on the one hand and paradoxes and
                  orations on the other is not absolute, as the former often incorporated the
                  latter. (For Inns of Court orations, see Appendixes 3 and 6.1.) The Inner
                     Temple tragedy Gorboduc consists largely of formal
                  disquisitions by royal advisors. The ‘Montagu Oration’ of 1565/6
                  and the ‘Sussex Oration’ of 1566 celebrated the marriages of the
                  earl of Southampton and the daughter of the earl of Sussex respectively. According
                  to their titles the first was ‘made &amp; <expan>p<ex>ro</ex>nunced</expan> by Mr Pownde of
                  lyncolnes Inne <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> a brave maske owt of the same howse,’ while the
                  second was ‘made &amp; <expan>p<ex>ro</ex>nou<ex>n</ex>ced</expan> by Mr Pownd of lincolnes
                  Inne <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> a Maske.’ The 1594–5 Gesta Grayorum includes six formal
                  orations composed by Francis Bacon and an oration in Latin by a schoolboy of St
                  Paul’s (Appendix 1, pp 405–12, 424–5). John Hoskins delivered his ‘Fustian
                     Answer Made to a Tufftaffata Speech’ at the Middle
                     Temple in 1597–8, yielding evidence also of the original (but lost)
                     ‘Tufftaffata Speech’ (Appendix 1, pp 456–7). An oration in
                  French is referenced in a dedicatory letter published by Bartholomew Yong in 1598
                  (see p 130).</p>

               <p> Similarly John Chamberlain wrote on 15 January 1604/5 of a Christmas
                  entertainment at the Middle Temple (Appendix 4, p 686,
                  ll.8–11): ‘... by reason of ye press of people nothing could be done that night.
                  onely mr Ross made an extemporal speach in excuse; and though a man might sweare
                  it was not studied, yet was he charged by malitious fellows to haue lett in
                  company of purpose to haue occasion for a speach....’</p>

               <p> Also about 1605 the Inner Temple was the venue for two
                  orations, Heneage Finch’s ‘Arithmetic Lecture’ and Francis
                  Beaumont’s ‘Grammar Lecture’ (Appendix 3, pp 651–66), while Edward
                  Pudsey records a series of paradoxes which seem to derive from a Middle Temple
                  entertainment c 1610 (Appendix 1, pp 485–8). The
                     Inns of Court gentleman who played Paradox in the
                     Gray’s Inn
                  Masque of Mountebanks of 1617–18 (Appendix 2) was much commended,
                  as in Gerard Herbert’s contemporary letter (Appendix 4, pp 696–7): ‘The speeches
                  weare acted by some of there owne gentlemen: one, called paradox, who spake most,
                  &amp; pleasinge in many thinges, was much comended for well discharginge his
                  place, &amp; good vtterance in speech....’ The same paradoxes survive in
                  manuscript (Appendix 6.1) and in an appendix to Sir Thomas Overbury his
                     Wife (London, 1632; STC : 18918, sigs V2–8v), in two parts: ‘Paradoxes,
                  as they were spoken in a Maske, and presented before his Maiesty at White-hall’;
                  and ‘The Mountebankes Receipts.’</p>

               <p>As Inns of Court gentlemen tended to come from wealthy landed
                  families, many were proud and skilled horsemen. Accordingly many an Inns
                     of Court entertainment betrayed a fondness for equestrian and even
                  military spectacle. Lincoln’s Inn archives mention attendance
                  at royal jousts in 1466–7, 1477–8, 1494–5, 1508–9, 1510–11, 1532–3 (for the
                  coronation of Anne Boleyn), and 1546–7; Furnival’s Inn archives contain a similar
                  reference in 1501–2; while in a letter of 6 July 1566 the Spanish ambassador
                  describes yet another joust.</p>

               <p>The earliest mention of an equestrian ‘riding’ performed by members of the
                     Inns of Court occurs in Henry Machyn’s 1561–2 diary. He
                  writes that on 27 December a lord of misrule rode through London in a gilded
                  harness, with 100 horses and gentlemen riding with chains of gold, presumably to
                  the Inner Temple (Appendix 4, p 683). The Montagu oration of
                  Shrovetide 1565/6 was associated with a ‘brave maske’ out of Lincoln’s
                     Inn, on ‘greatte horses’ (Appendix 3, p 625).</p>

               <p> At least two Stuart masques involved elaborate ridings. The first is described by
                  John Chamberlain in his letter of 18 February 1612/13 (Appendix 4, pp 687–8):
                     <quote> on munday night was the Middle Temple and Lincolns

                     pages rode likewise vpon horses exceedingly well trapped and furnished. besides
                     a dousen litle boyes drest like babones that serued for an antimaske, (and they

                     King stoode in the gallerie to behold them and made them ride about the
                     tilt-yard...</quote> A riding was also a major feature of James Shirley’s
                  masque, The Triumph of Peace, sponsored and performed twice by the
                  four Inns of Court in February 1633/4. John Finet waxed lyrical
                  in his memoirs (see p 310), writing that 100 gentlemen, who rode in front of the
                  masquers, were ‘bravely mounted on great horses richely caparossond, themselves
                  all in chinquant sutes,’ while the sixteen masquers were drawn in four chariots
                  with four horses drawing each. The provision of coats for the 100 riders was a
                  major part of the expense, which burdened the four Inns for years to come.</p>

               <p> On 4 November 1616, for the installation of Prince Charles as prince of Wales,
                  the four Inns mounted a ‘barriers,’ defined by Alan Young as ‘a form of foot
                  combat that eventually became a familiar event at most tournaments. Opponents,
                  either singly or in groups, were separated by a waist-high wooden barrier and
                  fought each other either with swords or long staves. In the sixteenth and
                  seventeenth centuries, combats at barriers were frequenly held indoors and
                  accompanied by disguisings and the use of scenic devices and music.’ [22. The genre is described at length by Alan Young,
                        Tudor and Jacobean Tournaments (London and Dobbs Ferry, NY,
                     1987), 193, figs 15, 40.] An anonymous untitled text for the 1616
                  barriers survives in manuscript (Appendix 3, pp 666–71). It was perhaps the
                  success of the entertainment that provoked a letter from the king dated 10 March
                  1616/17 requesting that 600 gentlemen from the Inns form themselves into a
                  military company. [23. LI Arch: A1a6 (Black Book 6), ff
                     642v–3v; see Baildon (ed), Black Books, vol 2, p 193.]</p>

               <p> The gentlemen of the four Inns were supported in November 1616 by professional
                  players, as indicated by apparently unique verses cited in Appendix 6.1 (pp
                  744–5): named are not only the ‘Young Gentlemen’ of the Inns, but four members of
                  the king’s men: John Heminges (?), Richard Burbage, Nathan Field, and Henry
                  Condell.</p>

               <p> Yet another ‘ceremony’ associated with Inns of Court Christmas
                  revels involved the shoot- ing of cannon (also called ‘chambers’). The tradition
                  is first mentioned by Gerard Legh in his Accedens of Armory, which
                  describes events of 1561–2 (Appendix 1, pp 366–7). For the Inner
                        Temple and Gray’s Inn masque of
                  February 1612/13 cannon were discharged thrice during the procession by Thames
                  barges (Appendix 4, p 688, ll.25–31): <quote>they made choise to come by water
                     from winchester place in Southwarke: (<expan>w<ex>hi</ex>ch</expan> suted well enough with

                     Rhine: and theyre shew by water was very gallant by reason of infinite store of

                     landing...</quote> The discharge of cannon gave rise in 1622–3 to a notable
                  rumour, elsewhere associated with the gentlemen of Inner Temple
                  (Appendix 4, pp 697–8): <quote>The gentlemen of Grayes Inne to make an end of
                     Christmas on Twelfe night, in the dead time of the night shott of all the

                     carts.<lb/> The King awakened with this noise, started out of his bed, &amp;

                     Londoners. &amp; so I leaue them.</quote>

               </head>

               <p> Music was an integral part of Inns of Court entertainment
                  apparently from the beginning. [24. This section of the
                     Introduction is heavily indebted to Professor Elliott’s essay, ‘Invisible
                     Evidence,’ pp 45–57.] This point is made very clear by the report of John
                  Spelman c 1500 (see pp 26–7), which records some half a
                  dozen hymns, anthems, and songs ceremonially recited on Christmas day, along with
                  cheers of ‘Viva le roy’ and an ‘Oyez.’ The roughly contemporary legal manuscript
                  Cambridge University Library: Ms L1.1.11, f 32 (see Appendix 13, p 784) contains
                  several texts of the carol ‘Out of <expan>yo<ex>ur</ex></expan> slep arise &amp; wake,’ complete
                  with a musical score.</p>

               <p> Gerard Legh’s Accedens of Armory, recounting the Inner
                     Temple revels of 1561–2, includes a description of musical
                  accompaniment to a banquet: ‘And at euery course, The Trompetts blew the coragious
                  blast of deadly warre with noise of drome and fyffe, with ye swete Armony of
                  violetts, shakbutts, recorders, &amp; cornetts, | with other instruments of
                  musicke, as it semed Appollos harpe had tewned ther strock’ (Appendix 1, p 372,
                  ll.15–18). The Gray’s Inn accounts of 1583–4 and 1584–5
                  preserve yet more musical detail, cited here from the latter account: ‘Payd to
                  Cloughe the butler ... bookes to sing on at the revells....’ As ‘bookes’ is plural
                  in number, perhaps these were printed anthologies purchased from a bookstall. For
                  the celebra- tion of ‘Amity’ in the course of the 1594–5 Gesta
                     Grayorum (Appendix 1, p 399, ll.25–30): <quote> At the side of the
                     Hall, behind a Curtain, was erected an Altar to the Goddess of Amity; her
                     Arch-Flamen, ready to attend the Sacrifice and Incense that should, by her
                     Servants, be offered unto her: Round about the same sate Nymphs and Fairies,
                     with Instruments of Musick, and made very pleasant Melody with Viols and
                     Voices, and sang Hymns and Praises to her Deity.</quote> Several years later,
                  in 1597–8, gentlemen of the Middle Temple visited those of
                     Lincoln’s Inn, who ‘entertained them with variety of Musick’
                  (Appendix 1, p 479, l.11).</p>

               <p> Professional musicians, including harpers, fiddlers, and waits, were employed by
                  Furnival’s Inn (an Inn of Chancery) from 1407–8 to 1533–4. Entertainers
                  (‘histriones’) were employed by Lincoln’s Inn from 1445–6 (and
                  probably earlier). That these were minstrels is implied by an entry for 1447–8;
                  that they were servants of the Inn is implied by a 1487–8 payment to ‘entertainers
                  of the said Inn’ (‘<expan>histrionib<ex>us</ex></expan> <expan>dict<ex>i</ex></expan> <expan>hospici<ex>j’</ex></expan>).</p>

               <p> Beginning in 1546–7 the house musicians of Lincoln’s Inn are
                  named as Robert Jugleger and John Brayne alias Drayne. While the former remained
                  until 1563–4, the latter is last recorded in 1551–2. An apparent replacement, John
                  Gilbert, is recorded in one year only, 1552–3. In 1562–3 Richard Knight and
                  William Perryn appear in the Records, Knight surviving until 1574–5, Perryn until
                  1599–1600, the year of his death. Beginning in 1566–7 supplementary musicians were
                  hired ‘ffor theyr seruice’ on All Saints’ Day and Candlemas: among these were the
                  London wait Anthony Tyndale and his fellows (‘et socijs suis’), first recorded in
                  1574–5. By 1615–16 the Inn’s annual outlay for musicians at Christmas was £10 – an
                  amount recorded because it was deemed excessive.</p>

               <p> At the Inner Temple, where little or no information on music
                  survives from before 1610, house musicians were paid – or perhaps paid extra – for
                  performances on All Saints’ Day and Candlemas, with a performance on 5 November
                  (that is, Guy Fawkes Day) first recorded in 1610–11. Additional sums were paid for
                  playing over the Christmas season: for 1614–15, £12 the first week, £12 the
                  second, £11 the third, and £5 10s the fourth. Doubtless some of this music
                  accompanied the Inner Temple’s famous dances (discussed in the
                  next section). In subsequent years references occur to trumpeting for ‘healths ...
                  pledged through the hall.’ Over these same years the porter or panier man blew a
                  horn to signal the start of dinner.</p>

               <p> Prior to 1606–7 Inner Temple musicians apparently stood in the
                  ‘gallery in the hall,’ but in that year the gallery was pulled down, perhaps to
                  enlarge the dining area. Inner Temple records for 1614–15, 1615–16, and 1616–17
                  include references to ‘paynetinge of the Mussick Roome,’ ‘mendinge of the Clothe
                  for ye musicke Rome,’ and ‘Mending the Curteynes about the Musicke.’ The music
                  room may have been a walled and canopied platform, or perhaps something more
                  elaborate. A similar structure is recorded at Lincoln’s Inn in
                  1632–3 (p 232, ll.15–16).</p>

               <p>Of the four players at the Inner Temple who performed either
                  from the gallery or from the music room, the best documented is Henry Field. In
                  1636–7 Field is referred to as the leader of the consort and ‘an auncient servant
                  to this Howse’ (p 344). How ancient may be inferred from the fact that he was a
                  London wait from 1619 to 1641, and played in the Middle Temple
                  consort in 1618–19 (p 205). His name occurs among musicians hired for The
                     Triumph of Peace in 1633–4. This pattern of multiple employment was
                  common among London musicians who were not under royal or aristocratic patronage
                  and even among some who were. In a single year (1633–4) John Adson served as a
                  member of the London waits and the king’s musick, as well as the band at the Globe
                  and Blackfriars theatres – not to mention a one-off appearance in a masque at
                  court. Of the other three Inner Temple musicians, ‘Mr. Hall’ is
                  unknown, but William Saunder had in 1641 been a city wait for nearly twenty years
                  and was in that year a member of the king’s men’s band; while John Hopper, after
                  leading the house musicians for three years (1615–17), served as a violinist in
                  the king’s musick from 1621 to 1642.</p>

               <p> Records from Gray’s Inn and the Middle
                     Temple are less informative but show many of the same features. At
                     Gray’s Inn the musicians received a yearly salary of £2 in
                  the sixteenth century, rising to £4 in the seventeenth, for playing on All Saints’
                  Day and Candlemas. When they were hired for other nights, excluding the Christmas
                  season, the going rate in 1635–6 was 16d per night. At Christmas Gray’s
                     Inn resorted to the same system as Lincoln’s Inn,
                  the steward raising money from the members on a roll, to be paid directly to the
                  musicians. For some reason, however, the musicians’ roll at Gray’s Inn never
                  yielded a surplus, and we find the steward regularly receiving supplementary
                  payments for the Christmas musicians from the treasurer. Although very few of the
                  accounts have survived, we do get some exact figures. In 1568–9 the musicians at
                  Christmas received 26s 8d; in 1589–90 and 1599–1600, £7; in 1606–7, £8; and in
                  1607–8, £12, at which point the records fall silent. But the figures are enough to
                  indicate that the amount spent on music for the Christmas revels at
                     Gray’s Inn was only a fraction of that spent at the
                     Inner Temple, despite the fact that Gray’s
                     Inn at this time was the most populous of the Inns. This accords with
                  what we know from evidence in letters and memoirs: that it was the two Temples
                  which put on the most lavish revels, often so lavish that they attracted
                  spectators from the royal court.</p>

               <p> Of the named musicians at Gray’s Inn, ‘Mr Michell,’ whose
                  first name is never given, is first referred to as the leader of the consort in
                  1603–4 and presumably remained in that position until 1616–17, when the benchers
                  awarded him an annual pension of five marks for life. It is likely that he was the
                  same ‘John Mitchell’ who was a member of the Minstrels’ guild in London in
                     1604.25 [H.A.F. Crewdson, The Worshipful Company of
                        Musicians (London, 1950), 96.] The names of the other five who
                  made up the consort in 1619 are written onto the flyleaf of the first surviving
                  volume of the Gray’s Inn Pension Books (see p 203): Thomas Adson, Thomas Cordwell,
                  John Amaria of Onslow (Surrey), Robert Ammery, and William Tallice.</p>

               <p> With the list is a note dated 22 October 1618 to the effect that these men had
                  agreed ‘to serve this howse <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> Musicke for this next yeare following
                  for the Owld wages’ (that is, £4, as last recorded in the surviving accounts in
                  1607–8). Thomas Adson, whose position first on the list suggests that he was the
                  leader, was probably John Adson, who in 1619 was one of the London waits – though
                  John Adson had a son, whose first name is unknown, who played with the waits some
                  years later. Thomas Cordwell, a violinist, is only recorded elsewhere as the
                  leader of a consort who played for the earl of Dorset in 1607. He is probably not
                  to be confused with his near-namesake, Thomas Cardell, who was a lutenist and
                  dancing master at the court of Queen Elizabeth. [26. Kent
                     Archives Office: U269/Al/l. We are grateful to Lynne Hulse for this reference.
                     On Cardell, see John M. Ward, ‘Sprightly and Cheerful Musick. Notes on the
                     Cittern, Gittern &amp;24; and Anne Batchelor, ‘Daniel Bacheler: The Right
                     Perfect Musician,’ The Lute 28 (1988), 3–12.] John Amaria
                  of Onslow is possibly so called to distinguish him from his anglicized namesake,
                  Robert Ammery, who follows him in the list. Both may be descended from the famous
                  Italian musician, John Maria of Cremona, who had come to England in the middle of
                  the previous century. Finally William Tallice is another bearer of a distinguished
                  musical name, although like the two Amarias, or Ammerys, nothing further is known
                  of him.</p>

               <p> When we turn to the Middle Temple records, we find only the
                  barest hints of the riches which we know from other sources ought to be there. The
                  earliest reference to musicians is to a group of minstrels who performed at
                  Christmas in 1509–10 for a total fee of 25s. By 1524 this entertainment had been
                  reduced to a single harper, who received 20s and an invitation to come back in the
                  future. The records are then lost until 1551–2, when we find that the single
                  ‘minstrell of the temple’ was a man named Nicholas Killingworth, whose yearly wage
                  was still 20s. Nothing further is heard on this subject until 1572–3, when it was
                  ordered that the minstrels ‘now serving the Inn’ should have a yearly salary of
                  26s 8d, plus 40s for the Christmas revels. This resembles the formula at Lincoln’s
                  Inn and the Inner Temple, though the actual salary is only half
                  of what Lincoln’s Inn was paying to Perryn and Knight in that
                  same year. The allowance of 40s for the Christmas music, which is repeated in the
                  parliament minutes every year thereafter, must be a mere administrative formula,
                  as that sum could not possibly have met the cost of four weeks of revelling. It
                  may simply be a way of saying that the benchers were willing to pay an extra 40s
                  on top of the money collected for the musicians by the steward, if the model of
                  other Inns was followed.</p>

               <p> After 1572–3 there are no further references to individual musicians or to
                  specific bands of musicians from the Middle Temple Parliament
                  Books. A bit of additional information can be gleaned, however, in the
                     Middle Temple archives. The first item of interest is a
                  receipt, dated 2 February 1612/13: ‘Receaved by mee Iohn Dowland for my selfe and
                  my fellowes Musitians, vpon candellmas Daye, 1612 for the consorte
                  <expan>p<ex>er</ex>formed</expan> before the Iudges and Reverent benchers, of the honnorable
                  Society, of the Midle Temple....’ The receipt is for the sum of £5, which is
                  indicative of the status of John Dowland in English musical life at this time, a
                  status he is at pains to emphasize by signing himself ‘<expan>Io<ex>hn</ex></expan> dowlande,
                  Lutenist to the <expan>King<ex>es</ex></expan> <expan>ma<ex>ies</ex>tie</expan>’ (an appointment he had only
                  recently received). The document is also signed by two other men, William Corkine
                  and Richard Goosey. Corkine is known as the author of two books of airs with lute
                  and viol accompaniment published in 1610 and 1612 but there is no other reference
                  to him as a performer. [27. Frank, ‘A New Dowland Document,’
                     pp 15–16.] Richard Goosey is completely unknown. It may or may not be
                  mere coincidence that a man named Richard Goosey was the assistant steward of the
                  Middle Temple about this time (1617), but the person who signed the receipt
                  clearly did so in his capacity as a visiting musician, not as a servant of the
                  society. Whether Corkine and Goosey constituted all of the ‘fellowes Musitians’
                  who appeared with Dowland in this consort, or whether they were signing on behalf
                  of still other unnamed players, is not clear. It was, however, unusual for more
                  than one person to sign such a receipt. There are four similar receipts among the
                  loose papers at the Middle Temple, and all are signed by a
                  single musician on behalf of a consort. It is probable, therefore, that Dowland
                  led a three-man consort on this occasion, though what instruments they played is
                  not indicated.</p>

               <p>In the same year that Dowland gave his concert for the judges, a different consort
                  received 40s for their services in the Michaelmas term of 1612–13, signed for by
                  John Papson, a member of the London Minstrels’ guild. This payment was delayed
                  until June, probably because the Inn was out of pocket after footing the bill for
                  a masque at court in February, the usual month for paying the house musicians
                  their annual salary. The delay caused Papson to send a written petition to the
                  benchers, which survives on a different slip, wherein he lists the exact dates on
                  which the consort played (see pp 161–2): ‘We your poore orratoures the mvsissians
                  intreates your worshipes for fower nightes paye’; namely Thursday, 5 November;
                  Saturday, 7 November; Saturday, 5 December (Prince Henry’s funeral was on Monday,
                  7 December); and Saturday, 26 December. This lends credence to the statement by
                  Sir Robert Brerewood in his manuscript notes on the history of the Inn, written
                  about this time, that at the Middle Temple the so-called
                  ‘Christmas sports’ began on the eve of All Saints and then went on ‘continuely ...
                  every Saturday weeklie after supper ended.’ [28. Cited from
                     Robert W. Wienpahl, Music at the Inns of Court During the Reigns of
                        Elizabeth, James, and Charles (Ann Arbor, 1989), 165–6.]</p>

               <p> Papson and Brerewood both specify that all the musical performances took place at
                  night; indeed revels and masques were always held at night, under artificial light
                  ‘specially Coloured and Varied,’ as Bacon remarks in his Essayes
                  (Appendix 12, p 782). The wording of Papson’s petition suggests that his consort
                  was the regular house music in this year. They would normally also have been
                  employed on Candlemas Day, but for some reason they were replaced by Dowland’s
                  group on that occasion; perhaps there was a connection with his performance
                  thirteen days later in the Middle Temple’s masque at court. It
                  is not surprising that the petition does not mention the Christmas revels, since
                  if Papson’s consort played for them they would have been paid separately by the
                  steward.</p>

               <p> Two years later (1614–15) we find Papson receiving the money for the musicians’
                  annual salary. In this entry (see p 184, ll.34–6) he is called ‘one of the
                  musicions that s<ex>er</ex>veth the Howse,’ and the money is paid to him ‘for his
                  &amp; his fellowes yearely fee.’ Aside from docu- ments connected with the
                  production of court masques, there are no further references in the archives to
                  the domestic consumption of music in the Middle Temple until the very last years
                  of our period. In 1637–8 the annual payment to the musicians was signed for by
                  Thomas Hunter and in the following two years by Geoffrey Collins. Hunter is not
                  otherwise known but Collins, whose name appears in 1632–3, 1633–4 , 1638–9,
                  1639–40, and 1641–2, was a member of several theatre bands, though his instrument
                  is unknown. [29. John P. Cutts, ‘New Findings with Regard to
                     the 1624 Protection List,’ Shakespeare Survey 19 (1966), 101–7; and Bentley,
                        Jacobean and Caroline Stage, vol 2, p 409.] In this
                  period the acting company at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane known as Beeston’s
                  boys was one of two that were regularly hired to perform plays at the
                     Middle Temple on All Saints and Candlemas (the other being
                  the queen’s men at Salisbury Court). The Inn seems to have had the same working
                  arrangement with the Cockpit band, since in 1641–2 we again find Collins
                  collecting the money for the musicians. In 1640–1, however, it was collected by
                  John Gamble, who was probably a member of the king’s men’s band, since he composed
                  several songs for that company. He is known to have played the violin and cornet,
                  and to have been a student of Ambrose Beeland, a violinist for both the king’s
                  musick and the king’s men under Charles i. Gamble became a member of the king’s
                  musick under Charles II. [30. Cutts, ‘New Findings,’ p 102;
                     and Andrew Ashbee, Records of English Court Music, Volume I,

               </head>


               <p>The earliest reference to dancing in the Records derives from Furnival’s Inn (an
                  Inn of Chancery), where at Christmas in 1494–5 the hall was decorated with
                  hangings of crimson fabric and ‘matted for the Revellers to daunce vpon....’ Music
                  for this dancing was apparently supplied by waits and a harper. The same elements
                  obtained for the same Inn for Christmas 1503–4: ‘whereas was muche dancinge &amp;
                  Revellinge/ and for that purpose, the minstralsey of the Ladie Princes and her
                     <expan>Servant<ex>es</ex></expan> were heare, <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> the <expan>wait<ex>es</ex></expan> of London, the
                  harpur and other musicall <expan>Instrument<ex>es</ex></expan>.’ If anything, preparations this
                  year were even more elaborate, especially in the provision of musicians.</p>

               <p> The importance of dancing for the Inns of Court is recognized
                  by the report of the royal commission of c 1534–47 (see p 62): ‘In this Christmas
                  time, they have all manner of pastimes, as singing and dancing....’ In his
                     Accedens of Armory Gerard Legh employs ‘mask’ or ‘maske’ as a
                  verb signifying ‘to dance’ (Appendix 1, p 379, ll.33–4): ‘And after for theyr
                  solace, they masked with Bewties dames.’ Beauty in this instance was a character
                  in The Masque of Beauty and Desire (attributed to Arthur Brooke).
                  In March 1564/5 the Spanish ambassador heaped praise (cited here in translation)
                  upon the dancing which followed the Gray’s Inn ‘Masque
                     of Juno and Diana’: ‘when the masque was finished there soon entered
                  two quadrilles of twelve gentlemen each. They were the same who had fought on
                  horseback and fought on foot, and afterwards, armed as they were, they danced with
                  the ladies.’</p>

               <p> Dancing seems also to have featured in The Misfortunes of Arthur
                  in 1587/8 at Gray’s Inn, as recorded (among other sources) in a contemporary poem
                  (see p 114): <lg>
                     <l>And <expan>y<ex>o</ex>w</expan> suete gentilmen of Grayan name</l>
                     <l> Well was a solace to her highnes meant</l>
                     <l> And all that passed from <expan>y<ex>o</ex>w</expan> deseru’s good fame</l>
                     <l> Your mend’ments good . your acting excellent</l>
                     <l> But when your Spyks of Poesie be ripe</l>
                     <l> Dance haruest home after a better pipe.</l>
                  </lg> The Gesta Grayorum of 1594–5 records preparation for mixed
                  dancing on the night which featured Shakespeare’s Comedy of Errors:
                  ‘it was thought good not to offer any thing of Account, saving Dancing and
                  Revelling with Gentlewomen’ (Appendix 1, p 397, ll.10–11). On another occasion,
                  however (Appendix 1, p 395, ll.4–10): <quote> ...His Highness called for the
                     Master of the Revels, and willed him to pass the time in Dancing: So his
                     Gentlemen-Pensioners and Attendants, very gallantly appointed, in thirty
                     Couples, danced the Old Measures, and their Galliards, and other kind of
                     Dances, revelling until it was very late; and so spent the rest of their
                     Performance in those Exercises, until it pleased His Honour to take his way to
                     his Lodging, with Sound of Trumpets, and his Attendants in order, as is above
                     set down.</quote> Heneage Finch, in his ‘Arithmetic Lecture’ of
                     c 1605, mentions the cinquepace (‘Cinquapase,’ Appendix
                  3, p 656, l.37), a dance made notorious by Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Twelfth
                     Night (performed at the Middle Temple on 2 February
                  1601/2). In his letter of 18 February 1612/13 John Chamberlain waxes enthusiastic
                  on the subject of dancing by gentlemen of the Inns of Court:
                  ‘themselues and theyre devises ... made such a glittering shew that the king and
                  all the companie were exceedingly pleased and specially <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> theyre
                  dauncing. <expan>w<ex>hi</ex>ch</expan> was beyond all that hath ben yet’ (Appendix 4, p 688,
                  ll.14–17). Chamberlain was seconded by other observers the same year. Later, in a
                  letter of 21 February 1617/18, Nathanael Brent reported to Sir Dudley Carleton
                  that the gentlemen of Gray’s Inn ‘pleased tolerably wel. for
                  divers of ye 18 maskers danced gracefully enough, and there was in it some wittie
                  ribalderie <expan>y<ex>a</ex>t</expan> made ye companie merrie’ (Appendix 4, p 696, ll.14–16).
                  The next day, 22 February, Gerard Herbert advised Carleton: ‘Grayes Inn maske ...
                  was well liked, &amp; the dances well performed of the gentle men: the ayres &amp;
                  dances well deuised: Some of the <expan>danc<ex>e</ex>rs</expan> danct by the voices of boyes (in
                  stead of musick) <expan>w<ex>hi</ex>ch</expan> songe excellent well...’ (Appendix 4, p 696,
                  ll.33–6).</p>

               <p>Recalling his 1628–9 mastership of the revels, Bulstrode Whitelocke, writing in
                  the third person, describes a typical Saturday evening among the Middle Templars:
                  ‘They began with the old measures after that, they daunced the Braules then the
                     M<ex>aste</ex>r took his seat, &amp; the Reuellers daunced Galliards,
                  Corantoes, &amp; french daunces, then countrey daunces till it grew very late’
                  (see p 224, ll.11–13). Whitelocke’s reference to ‘old measures’ followed by a
                  variety of what seems to have been more recent measures provides an opportunity to
                  note that certain Inns of Court gentlemen of this period took
                  lessons from dancing masters (see Appendix 14, pp 793–4, 801, 811–12).</p>

               <p>Anticipating The Triumph of Peace of February 1633/4, already in
                  preparation at the time of his letter of 17 October 1633, Thomas Coke wrote to his
                  father, Sir John (Appendix 4, p 700, ll. 11–21): <quote>The æmulation that will be
                     between the Ins of Courtmen, &amp; the Courtiers you may easily imagine, But

                  choreographer remains unknown. William Crofts composed an elaborate joke on 1
                  February 1633/4, several days before the event (Appendix 4, p 701): <quote> wee
                     are heere in a greate expectation of a horse maske and a foote maske by the

                     then they can when they are | on there owne legges...</quote> In his
                  recollection of The Triumph of Peace Whitelocke recounts the
                  participation of the queen and ladies from her court (see p 277, ll.30–3): ‘The
                  Queen did the honor to some of the Masquers to daunce with them herselfe, &amp; to
                  iudge them, as good dauncers as euer she sawe, &amp; the great Ladyes were very
                  free &amp; ciuill in dauncing with all the Masquers as they were taken out by
                  them.’ Again at the repeat performance at Merchant Taylors’ Hall, as reported by
                  John Finet: ‘After the maskers had danced the Kyng Queen Lordes and Ladyes fell to
                  dancyng...’ (see p 310, ll.38–9).</p>

               <p>A number of manuscripts contain descriptions of dances and even systematic
                  choreographies of the Inns of Court and especially the
                     Inner Temple. [31The editors express
                     their gratitude to Nina Monahin, who supplied information and wording for the
                     present discussion of dancing in the Inns of Court, including the list of
                     manuscripts in Appendix 13, p 284. Monahin in turn acknowledges her
                     indebtedness to Ingrid Brainard, ‘The Role of the Dancing Master in 15th
                     Century Courtly Society,’ Fifteenth Century Studies 2 (1979),
                     21–44.] Listed in Appendix 13 (p 784) are one apparently unique
                  manuscript from around 1500, one cluster of seven later manuscripts, and a
                  recently discovered fragment. One particular manuscript from the cluster of seven,
                  the mid- to late-seventeenth century Royal College of Music: Ms 1119, ff 1–2v,
                  contains not only choreographies but music. Yet another manuscript describing
                     Inner Temple dance routines is transcribed in Appendix 9.
                  Though the seven-manuscript cluster comprises manuscripts from the mid-sixteenth
                  century to the latter half of the seventeenth, the choreographies are remarkably
                  consistent though they do not all derive from the same source.</p>

               <p> A comparison of the Inns of Court dance manuscripts to
                  citations in the Records strongly suggests that Inns of Court
                  dancing fell into two categories. Ancient, relatively static, and tradition-bound
                  dances dating from the mid-sixteenth century (or earlier) characterized internal
                  Christmas revels. Contemporary social dances, by contrast, were used for
                     Inns of Court masques, especially when female spectators
                  were taken by the gentlemen as partners. Though it may be tempting to suppose that
                  the ‘old measures’ were danced exclusively by Inns of Court
                  males, evidence from the Records, from personal recollections, and from the dance
                  manuscripts themselves, points repeatedly to the presence of women on many (though
                  perhaps not all) occasions of dancing in the Inns of Court.</p>

               <p> Wanting endowments the Inns of Court generally survived on
                  annual charges to members, admission fees, chamber rents, and fines, including
                  fines for refusal to serve as master of the revels. Any surplus was carried over

                  from stock was not to be a precedent. The financing of any future ‘comedy or shew’
                  was to be arranged in advance.</p>

               <p> Students involved in the ‘Christmas Prince’ revels at St John’s
                  College, Oxford, in 1607–8, solicited former members and friends of the college
                  for funding. [32. <title>REED: Oxford</title>, vol 1, pp
                     345–6, 360–1; vol 2, pp 611, 613.] In 1635–6, for the same college,
                  Archbishop William Laud dipped into his own pocket to fund George Wild’s
                     Love’s Hospital. [33. REED:
                        Oxford, vol 1, p 606.] The Inns of Court at
                  various times adopted both these expedients. Thus the gentlemen of Gray’s
                     Inn, for their Gesta Grayorum revels of 1594–5, and
                  those of the Middle Temple, for their revels of 1597–8,
                  appealed by letter to senior members and friends. One Middle
                     Temple letter of solicitation survives, endorsed by Gilbert Talbot,
                  earl of Shrewsbury, with an annotation in his own hand noting his gift of £30 (see
                  pp 129–30).</p>

               <p> Francis Bacon personally underwrote the Gray’s Inn
                     masque of 1613/14 in the amount, it was said, of £2,000; Bacon refused
                  assistance from Sir Henry Yelverton in the amount of £500 (Appendix 4, p 692,
                  ll.14–18). Inns of Court gentlemen who served as Christmas
                  prince did so, as we have seen, largely at their own expense. Bulstrode Whitelocke
                  of the Middle Temple seems to have composed his annals to
                  explain to his children and grandchildren why their inheritance was so small: he
                  had spent much of the family fortune on revels and masques, particularly on the
                  February 1633/4 Triumph of Peace. [34. This
                     opinion was expressed in handwritten memos found among Professor Elliott’s
                     papers.]</p>

               <p> The Inns also resorted to private loans, liquidated by taxations upon members and
                  residents. Thus funds toward the Gesta Grayorum of 1594–5 were
                  borrowed from Mr William Mills, with a promise of repayment by the end of the
                  following term. To that end a tax was laid upon members, graded by rank: readers,
                  10s; ancients, 6s 8d; utter-barristers, 5s; all other gentlemen, 4s. Additionally
                  the ‘publique Stock’ of the ‘said house’ contributed £30.</p>

               <p> Taxation, in this and subsequent cases, required pressure on those taxed, ranging
                  from repeated demands, to naming and shaming, to threats of expulsion. Malingerers
                  were pursued relentlessly; indeed the bulk of masque records relate to
                  post-performance taxations. Lincoln’s Inn had a collection in
                  1597–8 for the ‘shew the last Chrestmas.’ Efforts of the Middle
                     Temple to pay off debts from 1612–13 continued to 1616–17. As late as
                  1640–1 the treasurer of the Middle Temple was still collecting
                  money ‘on the masque roll,’ whether for the 1633/4 Triumph of Peace
                  or for the 1635/6 Triumphs of the Prince d’Amour.</p>

               <p> For the Inns of Court masques of 1612/13 ‘maskinge apparrel’
                  was given out to gentlemen participants. Each suit cost ‘above a Hundred Markes’ –
                  or more than £66 13s 8d (see pp 150–1). Governors of Gray’s Inn
                  demanded either the return of the apparel or £30 in cash. Shirkers were threatened
                  with expulsion from chambers.</p>

               <p> On the expenditure side more than thirty receipts survive from the masque the
                  Middle Temple shared with Lincoln’s Inn in 1612/13, along with
                  a detailed list of payments by Christopher Brooke of Lincoln’s
                     Inn (see pp 155–9). For The Triumph of Peace of
                  1633/4, performed by all four Inns, the treasurer was John Herne, also of
                     Lincoln’s Inn. Warrants for some sixty-eight major expenses
                  directed to the Middle Temple survive in a virtually complete
                  series. Tucker Orbison, who analyzes both the 1612/13 and the 1633/4 expenditures
                  at length, concludes that the total cost of the latter was only marginally less
                  than the £21,000 reported in contemporary letters. [35.
                     Orbison, ‘Chapman’s The Memorable Masque,’ pp 1–30; and
                     ‘Shirley’s The Triumph of Peace,’ pp 31–84.]</p>

               <p> In 1639–40 the governors of the Middle Temple ordered the
                  dissolution of Christmas due to excessive expenditure: <quote>the licentious
                     expensivenes of some <expan>gent<ex>lemen</ex></expan> in those times is so great, as exceeds

                  suggests that artisans who supplied accoutrements for masques had been left in the

               <p> Almost by definition revels (root: ‘rebellare,’ to rebel) entailed a breach of
                  order, though within strict limits. Thus it may seem scarcely worth noting that
                     Inns of Court gentlemen were occa- sionally admonished,
                  chastised, or fined for breaches of the peace. At Furnival’s Inn members were
                  fined in 1498–9 for being absent from hall at the time of revels. Assessments for
                  refusal to serve as master of the revels or other Christmas officers were so
                  commonplace that the topic has been covered under finances rather than
                  disorders.</p>

               <p>The elimination of the office of Jack Straw by Lincoln’s Inn in
                  1518–19 on pain of a £5 fine suggests a significant threat to the peace.
                  Night-wandering may be inferred from strictures against absence from hall in the
                  accounts of Gray’s Inn for 1529–30, or Lincoln’s
                     Inn for 1549–50. An entry from Gray’s Inn, 1570–1,
                  suggests more than normal wear-and-tear: ‘to the carpenter for mendynge tables and
                  trestles this winter broken <expan>w<ex>i</ex>th</expan> <expan>revell<ex>es</ex></expan> at sundrye tymes.’ A
                  similar Gray’s Inn expense, for similar reasons, occurs in the
                  following year, 1571–2, for the ‘great Showe.’</p>

               <p> Also at Gray’s Inn, in 1594–5, occurred the disorders reported
                  in the Gesta Grayorum (Appendix 1, pp 396–7): <quote>...there arose
                     such a disordered Tumult and Crowd upon the Stage, that there was no
                     Opportunity to effect that which was intended: There came so great a number of
                     worshipful Personages upon the Stage, that might not be displaced; and
                     Gentlewomen, whose Sex did privilege them from Violence, that when the Prince
                     and his Officers had in vain, a good while, expected and endeavoured a
                     Reformation, at length there was no hope of Redress for that present. The Lord
                     Ambassador and his Train thought that they were not so kindly entertained, as
                     was before expected, and thereupon would not stay any longer at that time, but,
                     in a sort, discontented and displeased. After their Departure the Throngs and
                     Tumults did somewhat cease, although so much of them continued, as was able to
                     disorder and confound any good Inventions whatsoever.’</quote> Such events are
                  further characterized as ‘great Disorders and Misdemeanours, by Hurly-burlies,
                  Crowds, Errors, Confusions, vain Representations and Shews’ (Appendix 1, p 397,
                  ll.25–6); but nothing in the history of the Inns of Court came
                  close to the riots which attended on plays at Cambridge over the 1610–11 Christmas
                     season. [36. REED: Cambridge, vol 1, pp
                     424–86; vol 2, pp 1030–4.]</p>

               <p> Among activities which threatened civil order was the practice, recorded at
                  Lincoln’s Inn in 1516–17 and explicitly forbidden at Gray’s Inn
                  in 1585–6, at the Middle Temple about the same time, and at the
                     Inner Temple in 1610–11, of breaking open chamber doors or
                  abusing fellows of the ‘house’ in the name of the Christmas lord – in the latter
                  instance accompanied by a note that ‘great disorder &amp; scurrilytie is brought
                  into this howse by lewde &amp; lasciuious playes.’ [37On
                     Middle Temple disorders, see Records, pp 118–19, and endnote.] An unnamed
                  offence at Christmas was discouraged at Lincoln’s Inn in 1607–8
                  and steps were taken that year and the next for ‘better order.’ As late as 1627–8
                  the Christmas lord lieutenant of the Inner Temple was arrested
                  for the same offence when his attempt to collect ‘taxes’ was met with silence or
                     refusal. [38. On Inner Temple disorders, see especially
                     the letters of Joseph Mede (Appendix 4, pp 698–9). See also Nelson, ‘“Give
                     Fire, Gunner!”’ pp 46–8.]</p>

               <p> On 29 November 1627 the governors of Lincoln’s Inn noted ‘such
                  disorder and excesse as were the last Christmas,’ presumably Christmas 1626. In
                  1629–30 the same Inn identified as a particular ‘disorder’ that ‘woemen haue of
                  late resorted to <expan>o<ex>u</ex>r</expan> Revells’; as a remedy, ‘It is ordered the stayre
                  foote doore leading up to the gallery, where they stoode, bee from hence- forth
                  kept lockt every night of the Revells, and that noe <expan>p<ex>er</ex>sons</expan>
                     <expan>whatsoev<ex>er</ex></expan> be suffered to bee there at those tymes.’ We have noted
                  above (pp xxxvi–xxxvii) the disorder of 1639–40 which caused the privy council to
                  suspend Christmas festivities at the Inner Temple. The Inn
                  argued – evidently to no avail – that the suspension left it without proper
                  governance over the Christmas season. As civil war approached, however, the issue
                  became moot.</p>

               </head>

               <p> Music, revels, plays, masques, and other forms of entertainment occurred for the
                  most part in the halls of the several Inns. The earliest reference is at
                  Furnival’s Inn in 1494–5. The same hall is named in a similar context in 1497–8
                  and 1499–1500. In 1528–9 the hall was ‘newe tiled, and the Gallerie in the Hall
                  made’ and in 1533–4 on ‘the feast daie of Saint Katheryn. Musick in the Hall.’</p>

               <p> Putting aside Furnival’s Inn and other Inns of Chancery, of the four
                     Inns of Court, Gray’s Inn promulgated an
                  order in 1529–30 that ‘Fellows of this House ... when there are Revells, should
                  not depart out of the Hall, untill the said Revells were ended.’ [39. Halls of various Inns of Chancery, for which evidence is
                     scarce, are briefly described on REED’s Patrons and Performances Web
                        Site.] Members of Lincoln’s Inn were
                  disciplined in 1549–50 ‘for goyng out of the Hall on Hallowmas evyn at the tyme of
                  the <expan>Revell<ex>es</ex></expan>.’ Inner Temple Hall was
                  used for its 1561–2 Christmas revels, as evidenced by Gerard Legh’s
                     Accedens of Armory (see Appendix 1, p 371, l.22). In 1571–2
                     Gray’s Inn paid a carpenter ‘for mendynge formes and tables
                  in the hall after the great Showe.’ Gesta Grayorum, for 1594–5,
                  notes, ‘Want of Room in the Hall, the Scaffolds being taken away’ (Appendix 1, p
                  422, ll.13–14). References to hall performances become so numerous in the
                  seventeenth century that we refer the reader to the Index. It is nevertheless
                  worth noting the details of a professional play performance recorded in 1618–19:
                  ‘Comody Called the brydgrom &amp; the madmane, presented in the mydell tempell
                  hall before the Ivdges/ &amp; the benchers/ on Candelmas Day last.’</p>

               <p> The halls of the several Inns of Court have been described,
                  with plans and photographs, in numerous publications, notably in volumes of the
                  Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (Figures 6–8), and in Pevsner’s Buildings
                  of England series. A focused survey, with a discussion of early dramatic uses, is
                  Robert E. Burkhart, ‘The Surviving Shakespearean Playhouses.’ See also further
                  architectural details, images, and bibliography for each of the four Inns on
                  REED’s Patrons and Performances Web Site, provided by
                  Sally-Beth MacLean.</p>

               <p>The typical Inn of Court hall had an open floor-plan with a screen and entrance
                  doors at the lower end, and a dais at the upper end; a peaked roof supported by
                  open beams; a central fire-pit with louvre above; and glazed windows. As to size
                     Middle Temple Hall ranks with the largest of its age, while
                  the other three are (or were) of more modest dimensions. (The current
                     Inner Temple Hall is a modern building.) When used for
                  dining the halls were filled with tables and with chairs or benches (‘forms’); but
                  all such furniture was easily rearranged or cleared away, and possibly replaced
                  with scaffolds, for the sake of a play or a masque.</p>

                  Gray’s Inn Hall, constructed (or re-edified?) 1556–60, is
                  approximately 69’ in length by 35’ in width (Figure 3). [40.

                  took a direct hit from incendiary bombs during World War II, its glass had been
                  removed and its screens partly dismantled. The current hall is a careful
                  reconstruction. Its five bays are illuminated by clear-glass windows set high up
                  between the buttresses. Armorial glass in the gable end includes the name of John
                  Spencer, lord mayor of London, whose admission entry on 6 January 1597/8 was
                  signed by Henry Helmes, Prince of Purpoole.</p>

               <p>Inner Temple Hall, likely constructed in the fourteenth
                  century, was approximately 70’ in length by 29’ in width (Figure 2). [41. Royal Commission on Historical Monuments (England),

                  The medieval structure having been demolished in 1866, its replacement was
                  destroyed in World War II and subsequently rebuilt. The original interior had
                  four-centred arches in the side windows and Gothic arches in the gable ends. Side
                  windows on the north were small, those on the south, large and (apparently)
                  bright. In addition to screens at the lower end the hall contained a place for
                  musicians, pulled down in 1606–7 but rebuilt or replaced (as mentioned above) in
                  the years 1614–15 to 1616–17.</p>

               <p>Lincoln’s Inn ‘Old Hall,’ constructed 1489–92, was
                  originally some 60’ in length by 32’ in width, but was later extended by one bay
                  (Figure 4). [42. Royal Commission on Historical Monuments
                     (England), An Inventory of the Historical Monuments in London. Volume
                        II, pp 50–1; Cherry and Pevsner, London 4, p 286. See
                     also John W. Simpson, Some Account of the Old Hall of Lincoln’s
                        Inn (Brighton, 1920); and Burkhart, ‘Surviving Shakespearean
                     Playhouses,’ pp 180–6.] The result is an I-shaped floor-plan with four
                  oriel windows, two at each end. A screen, built by Robert Lyndon, dates from 1624.
                  The Records mention a ‘stayre foote doore leading up to the gallery’ in 1629–30
                  and a place for musicians in 1632–3. Presumably this gallery stood over the
                  screen. Superseded by a much larger Victorian hall in the 1840s, the original
                  structure survives as the ‘Old Hall.’ During a program of restoration in 1924–8
                  the screen-face was removed to the lower end wall, elimi- nating the original
                  passageway but increasing the useable floor-space. (The Old Hall was unscathed by
                  World War II.)</p>

                  Middle Temple Hall, constructed 1562–73, is approximately
                  88’ in length by 39’ in width, and 59’ to the peak of its spectacular double
                  hammerbeam roof (Figure 5). [43. Royal Commission on
                     Historical Monuments (England), Inventory of the Historical Monuments in

                  slightly smaller than the halls of Christ Church, Oxford, 1529–30, and Trinity
                  College, Cambridge, 1605–7.) Lying east-west it contains five bays, with
                  full-length oriel windows at its west (or upper) end and clear windows set high up
                  between the buttresses. The hall has been praised as ‘the finest Elizabethan
                  building in central London.’ [44. Bradley and Pevsner,
                        London 1, p 348.] The screen, with a ‘minstral’s gallery’
                  above, was constructed in the early 1570s, with two round-headed openings
                  (doorless before 1671). The screen was shattered but not burned by a bomb
                  explosion during World War II, when the stained glass had been removed for
                  safe-keeping. The roof was subsequently repaired, the screen rebuilt, and the
                  windows restored.</p>

                  Inns of Court plays and masques were often performed twice,
                  first at home and subsequently at court. [45. Royal
                     performance venues are discussed by John H. Astington, English Court
                        Theatre, 1558–1642 (Cambridge, 1999), 44–51 (Whitehall), 53 (‘Old’
                     Banqueting House and Inigo Jones’ ‘New’ Banqueting House), and 55–7
                     (Greenwich).] Performances before the monarch are recorded in the halls
                  of the palaces of Whitehall (January 1561/2, February
                  1612/13, February 1617/18) and Greenwich (February 1587/8,
                  March 1594/5). Whitehall venues also included the ‘Old’ Banqueting
                     House (February 1612/13, January 1613/14) and Inigo Jones’
                     ‘New’ Banqueting House (February 1633/4), constructed
                  1619–22 and still a stunning feature of Whitehall Road. The
                  February 1633/4 performance was repeated the same month at royal request in
                     Merchant Taylors’ Hall, on Threadneedle
                     Street in the heart of London. (For particulars of these
                  performances, see Appendix 8, Chronology.)</p>

               <p>Though dancing at the Inns must normally have been executed on hall floors, plays
                  and masques were performed on stage platforms erected along the sides of the hall
                  or, more fre- quently, at the lower end. Thus of two stage directions for the
                     Inner Temple masque Ulysses and Circe,
                  January 1614/15, the first specifies: ‘On one side the hall towardes the lower end
                  was discouered a cliffe of the sea’ (Appendix 2, p 549, ll.7–8); the second:
                  ‘While Circe was speakinge | first speech ... a trauers was drawne at ye lower end
                  of the hall, &amp; gaue way for the discouery of an artificiall wood’ (p 552,
                  ll.38–9).</p>

               <p>
                  Inns of Court masques performed in royal venues seem to have
                  been staged exclusively at the lower end of the hall, as with George Chapman’s
                     Memorable Masque of February 1612/13 (Appendix 2, p 508,
                  ll.3–4): ‘First there appear’d at the lower end of the | Hall, an Artificiall
                  Rock, whose top was neere as high as the hall it selfe.’ Similarly with the
                     Masque of Flowers of January 1613/14 (Appendix 2, p 538,
                  ll.31–5): <quote>AT the entrance of the King, at the lower end of the Banquetting
                     house, appeared a Trauers painted in Perspectiue, like the wall of a Cittie,
                     with battlements, ouer which were seene the Tops of houses. In the middle
                     whereof was a great gate, and on either side a Temple, the one dedicated to
                     Silenus, and the other to Kawasha, in either of which opened a little
                     gate.</quote> A similar configuration obtained twenty years later for Shirley’s
                     Triumph of Peace in February 1633/4 (Appendix 2, pp 594–5):
                     <quote>TThis Masque was presented in the Banquetting-house. At white Hall
                     before the King and Queenes Maiesties and a great Assembly of Lords and Ladies,
                     and other persons of quality, whose aspect setting on the degrees prepared for
                     that purpose gaue a great grace to this spectacle, especially being all richly
                     attired.<lb/> At the lower end of the roome opposite to the state was raysed a
                     Stage with a descent of staires in two branches landing into the
                     roome....</quote> Since most hall performances served as rehearsals for
                  performances in royal venues, scenes set at or near the lower end of the hall may
                  have been the norm, perhaps forced there by the fact that at court the monarch
                  occupied the upper end. [46. This inference runs counter to
                     arguments previously urged by Burkhart, ‘Surviving Shakespearean Playhouses,’
                     pp 173–96; and by Alan H. Nelson, Early Cambridge Theatres: University,
                        College, and Town Stages, 1464–1720 (Cambridge, 1994).] Even
                  at home the Christmas prince sat enthroned at the upper end, as with the Prince of
                  Purpoole at Gray’s Inn in 1594–5 (Appendix 1, p 399, ll.18–23):
                     <quote> ...the Prince came into the Hall with his wonted State, and ascended
                     his Throne at the high End of the Hall, under His Highness’s Arms; and after
                     him came the Ambassador of Templaria, with his Train likewise, and was placed
                     by the Prince as he was before; his Train also had Places reserved for them,
                     and were provided for them particularly....</quote> In 1635–6 the
                     Middle Temple Prince d’Amour was similarly positioned
                  ‘BEFORE the Scene was discovered, the Princes being prepar’d under the state at
                  the upper end of the Hall...’ (Appendix 2, p 613, ll.25–6).</p>

               <p>The ‘descent of staires in two branches landing into the roome’ for The
                     Triumph of Peace in 1633/4 gave easy access from the stage to the hall
                  floor, doubtless for dancing. Side-gallery seating for members of the audience
                  also helped to keep the floor free for dancing. Bulstrode Whitelocke, referring to
                  himself in the third person, illustrates the point for the same masque (Records, p
                  277, ll.19–24): <quote>The Horsemen of the Masque, and other gentlemen of the
                     Innes of Court, sate in the Gallery reserued for them, &amp; those of the
                     Committee that were present, were with them, only Hyde &amp; Whitelocke were
                     placed belowe among the Grandees, &amp; neare the Sceane, that they might be
                     ready to giue their assistance, if there should be occasion, &amp; as an
                     extraordinary fauour to them att that time, &amp; in that presence.</quote>
                  Documents show that as early as January 1561/2, for the performance either of
                     Gorboduc or a masque before Queen Elizabeth,
                     Whitehall Palace was fitted with ‘a grett skaffold in ye
                  hall ... &amp; ye morow after ye skaffold was taken done’ (Appendix 4, pp 683–4).
                  Similar provision was made in 1587–8, ‘makinge readie the halle and greate Chamber
                  for playes and daunsinge in the tyme of <expan>chr<ex>ist</ex>enmas</expan> and settinge vp
                  degrees against Twelfte nighte ... makinge of a great Scaffolde with degrees and
                     <expan>p<ex>ar</ex>tic<ex>i</ex>ons</expan> for a playe presented to the Queenes
                     <expan>ma<ex>ies</ex>tie</expan> by the Gentlemen of Greyes Inne’ (Appendix 5, p 717,
                  ll.35–8). Gesta Grayorum reveals, with reference to the performance
                  of <title>Comedy of Errors</title> in December 1594, that an imagined ‘Sorcerer or
                  Conjurer ... had caused the Stage to be built, and Scaffolds to be reared to the
                  top of the House, to increase Expectation’ (Appendix 1, p 397, ll.30–3).
                  Unanticipated confusion interfered with the intended performance, while a
                  subsequent performance scheduled for the Prince of Purpoole’s return from an
                  imagined journey to Russia was forestalled by the start of the new law-term
                  (Appendix 1, p 422, ll.9–16): <quote>...So that very good Inventions, which were
                     to be performed in publick at his Entertain- ment into the House again, and two
                     grand Nights which were intended at his Triumphal Return, wherewith his Reign
                     had been conceitedly determined, were by the aforesaid Readers and Governors
                     made frustrate, for the Want of Room in the Hall, the Scaffolds being taken
                     away, and forbidden to be built up again (as would have been necessary for the
                     good Discharge of such a Matter)...</quote> The dancing which followed was
                  confined to available floor-space (Appendix 1, p 425, ll.26–32): <quote>The Prince
                     ... came, after Supper, into the Hall, and there he danced and revelled among
                     the Nobles, and others of his own Court; and in like manner they spent the Day
                     following; but there was no other Performance, by reason of want of the Stage
                     and Scaffolds, till Shrovetide, that they went to the Court: And the things
                     that were then performed before Her Majesty, were rather to discharge our own
                     Promise, than to satisfie the Expectation of others.</quote> Royal expenditure
                  for the Shrovetide performance at court included ‘fyttinge of degrees’ (that is,
                  scaffolds) for both sides of the hall – presumably for the audience (Appendix 5, p
                  718, l.19).</p>

               <p> John Chamberlain remarked, in a letter of 18 February 1612/13, with reference to
                  one or the other (or both) of the Inns of Court masques brought
                  to court that year: ‘there were more scaffolds and more prouision made for roome
                  then euer I saw both in the hall and banketting roome’ (Appendix 4, p 689,
                  ll.16–17). Use of scaffolds is further confirmed by Dugdale, with reference to the
                     Inner Temple (Appendix 11, p 775): ‘IT is proper to the
                  Butler’s Office, to give warning to every House of Court, of this Banquet; to the
                  end that they, and the Inns of Chancery be invited thereto, to see a Play and
                  Mask. The Hall is to be furnished with Scaffolds to sit on, for Ladies to behold
                  the Sports, on each side.’</p>

               <p>Two technical innovations were adopted for the 1633/4 Triumph of
                     Peace. The first innovation, tickets to control admissions, is noted by
                  Bulstrode Whitelocke (see p 310, ll.8–10): ‘I tooke what order I could for placing
                  of theyr Secretareys and followers of best sort. so got Tickets for 24, which got
                  them entrance and seates with conveniency in the Banketting House....’ On 19
                  February 1633/4 William Gawdy wrote to Framlingham Gawdy (Appendix 4, pp 705–6):
                     ‘<expan>S<ex>i</ex>r</expan> you inioyned mee to send you a briefe relation howe I got into
                  the masque and howe I was placed: S<ex>i</ex>r Edmund Varney by the
                     mediatio<del>.</del> of my cosen Charles got mee a ticket and placed mee very
                  well in the midle gallery.’ This signification of ‘ticket’ antedates the earliest
                     <title>OEDO</title> reference (n.15.a.) by forty years. (The use of tickets was
                  resumed at the Restoration: see below, p xlvii.)</p>

               <p> The second innovation was the use of a ‘turning-chair,’ as described by George
                  Garrard in a letter of 27 February 1633/4 to Thomas Wentworth, earl of Strafford
                  (Appendix 4, p 707, ll.10–13): ‘The Templers were all invited, and well placed,
                  They have found a new way of letting them in by a Turning Chayre, besides they let
                  in none but such as haue Ticketts sent them before hand, so yat now the Keeping of
                  the Door is noe Troble ....’ Presumably the ‘Turning Chayre’ worked like a
                  turnstile, but further details are wanting.</p>

               <p>Finally an external part of Middle Temple hall was commandeered
                  for the Prince d’Amour revels of 1597–8 (Appendix 1, p 479,
                  ll.31–3): ‘Then Stradilax stept up upon the stone Staires in the Porch of the
                  Temple-Hall, from whence nothing but Oysters ever opened their mouthes with
                  eloquence.’</p>

               <p>As noted above (under ‘Martial Exercises’), on several occasions Inns of
                     Court gentlemen organized outdoor spectacles visible to the London
                  populace. Gesta Grayorum (Appendix 1, p 413, ll.33–8) describes a
                  February 1594/5 procession of the Prince of Purpoole and ‘the Ambassador of
                  Templaria’ to Crosby Place, residence of the current lord
                  mayor: ‘they rode very gallantly, from Grays-Inn, through
                     Chancery-lane, Fleet-street, so
                  through Cheap-side, Corn-hill, and
                  to Cosby’s Place, in
                     Bishop’s-gate-street’; at the conclusion of dinner, ‘the
                  Prince and his Company ... returned again the same Way.’ The 15 February 1612/13
                  procession of Lincoln’s Inn and Middle
                     Temple went from the Rolls Office in
                     Chancery Lane to Whitehall. [47. The beginning of the processional route at ‘the Maister of
                     the Rolls his house’ is reported in the title of The Memorable
                        Masque (Appendix 2, p 501), while the conclusion at
                        Whitehall is reported in the text (p 507,
                     ll.33–9).] The water-borne procession of Gray’s Inn
                  and Inner Temple a few days later began at
                     Winchester House in Southwark,
                  touched land at Temple Garden, and finished at the ‘priuie
                  stayres’ in Whitehall (Appendix 2, pp 526, l.10; and
                  Appendix 4, p 688, l.33). The procession of all four Inns in February 1633/4
                  assembled at Ely House and Hatton
                     House in Ely Place,

               <p> Though Christmas was cancelled at the Middle Temple in
                  1639–40, routine orders concerning Christmas resumed in 1640–1 and 1641–2. A more
                  detailed prohibition was promulgated by the Middle Temple in
                  1642–3, a year past the terminal date of REED: <quote>It is ordered
                     by the <expan>Ma<ex>ste</ex>rs</expan> of the Bench at this <expan>p<ex>ar</ex>liam<ex>en</ex>t</expan> that
                        <expan>Com<ex>m</ex>ons</expan> maye be kept in the house, &amp; so continue throughout the

                     And for this purpose the <expan>M<ex>aste</ex>rs</expan> of the Bench doe agree, for the

                     of the officers, out of the Treasurie of the house. And during the time of

                        agreed. [49. MT Arch: MT.1/MPA/No. 5, p 273 (25

                  music.</p>

               <p> In his Inns of Court and Early English Drama, A. Wigfall Green
                  carries his discussion of plays and masques to the end of the seventeenth century.
                  On 29 November 1651 Middle Temple performed a masque in which the benchers sang
                  Psalm 100 and drank hippocras: <quote> On Saturday night last there was a Masque
                     at the Middle Temple London, before it began the Benchers,
                     or ancients of the house were in the Hall and sung the hundred Psalm, which
                     being ended, every man drank a cup of Hipocras, and so departed to their
                     Chambers, then the young Gentlemen of that society began to recreate them-
                     selves with civil dancings and had melodious musick, many Ladyes and persons of
                     quality were present. [50. Perfect Passages of
                           Every Daies intelligence from the Parliaments Army, under the Command of
                           his Excellency the Lord General Cromwell (London, 1651), 323,
                        under the date 4 December 1651. Green, Inns of Court, p 136, omitting to
                        supply an explicit year, inadvertently implies a date of
                     1628.]</quote> Green also notes (p 153): ‘From 1650 to the end of the
                  century, numerous plays were presented by professional actors at the Inns
                     of Court. The records of the Inner Temple, though
                  frequently noting the amount paid “for a play,” sometimes give the name of the
                  play, and, less often, the name of the author.’ Green’s list (pp 154–6) is rich in
                  play titles from 1657 to 1687. Thus professional performances continued almost to
                  the end of the seventeenth century, even more richly documented after 1642 than
                  before.</p>

               <p> Two masques are recorded in the Restoration years. The first was presented by
                  Lincoln’s Inn on 3 January 1662/3 and published contemporaneously:
                     ‘Egkuklocoreía, or, Vniversal Motion Being part of that
                  Magnificent Entertainment by the Noble Prince, De la Grange, Lord Lieutenant of
                  Lincolns Inn, Presented to the High and Mighty Charles II, Monarck of Great
                  Brittain, France and Ireland, on Friday 3 of January 1662’ (London, 1662; Wing:
                  E253). Both John Evelyn and Samuel Pepys note the masque in their diaries. [51. Green, Inns of Court, pp 88–9.]
                  Evelyn confirms that the lord lieutenant of Lincoln’s Inn,
                  mentioned in the Records under 1617–18, was denomi- nated ‘the Prince de la
                  Grange.’ John Lort, who held the office this year, was duly knighted on 17 January
                     1661/2. [52. Shaw, Knights of England, vol
                     2, p 236. Green entitles this masque ‘The Dance of the Nations.’ [53Green, Inns of Court, pp 138–41.]</p>

               <p> A masque by Gray’s Inn in February 1682/3 is noted in the
                  diary of Narcissus Luttrell. [54. Green, Inns of
                        Court, pp 135–6.] Richard Gipps, admitted to Gray’s
                     Inn on 5 February 1675/6, was appointed master of the revels on 3
                  November 1682 and (as noted above) knighted for his service in this office at
                  Whitehall on 27 November 1682, even before the masque was realized. [55. Shaw, Knights of England, vol 2, p
                     258.] The image (if not the original) of a ticket printed for this event
                  survives today. [56. Though the original of the Gipps ticket
                     has not been traced, an image is printed in Nichols, Elizabeth,
                     vol 1, p xxi; and reprinted in Green, Inns of Court, p 136
                     (facing).]</p>
