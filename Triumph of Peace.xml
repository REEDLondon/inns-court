         <p>I Want words to expresse Your cheerefull and active desires, to present Your duties to
            their royall Maiesties, in this Masque: to celebrate, by this humble tender of Your

         <p>Your cleare devotions already offered, and accepted, let not me want an Altar for my
            Oblation to You. This entertaynment which tooke life from your command, and wanted no
            motion, or growth, it could derive from my weake Phansie: I sacrifice againe to You, and
            vnder Your smile to the world, let it not repent you to looke vpon, what is the second
            time made Your owne, and with it, the Heart of the Sacrificer, infinitely bound to
            acknowledge your free, and Noble soules, that have left no way for a Poet to satisfie
            his ambition, how to thanke you, but with thinking, he shall never be able to satisfie
            it.</p>
         <p>I dare not racke my preface to a length, proceede to be Your selues (the Ornament of our
            Nation,) and when You have leisure to converse with imaginations of this kinde, it shall
            be an addition to your many favours, to read these papers, and obliege beside, the
            seales of Your other encouragement,</p>

               single, sided with torch-bearers. Then three Dotterels in the same manner and

               silver: these upon every occasion moving too and fro, to preserue the order of their

         <p>TThis<note type="foot"><hi rend="italic">dittography</hi></note> Masque was presented in
            the Banquetting-house. At white Hall before the King and Queenes Maiesties and a great
            Assembly of Lords and Ladies, and other persons of quality, whose aspect setting on the
            degrees prepared for that purpose gaue a great grace to this spectacle, especially being
            all richly attired.</p>

         <p>At the lower end of the roome opposite to the state was raysed a Stage with a descent of
            staires in two branches landing into the roome. This Basement was painted in rusticke
            worke.</p>

         <p>The border of the front and sides that enclosed all the Sceane had first a ground of
            Arbor-worke entermixt with loose branches and leaues, and in this was two Niches, and in
            them two great figures standing in easy postures, in their naturall colors, and much
            bigger then the life, the one attired after the Grecian manner held in one hand a
            Scepter, and in the other a Scrowle, and a picked antique crowne on his head, his
            curasse was of Gold richly enchased, his robe blue and Siluer, his armes and thighs bare
            with buskinds enricht with ornaments of Gold, his browne locks long, and curled, his
            Beard thicke, but not long, and his face was of a grave and ioviall aspect, this figure
            stood on a round pedestall fained of white Marble, enricht with severall caruings; above
            this in a compartiment of Gold was written MINOS. The figure on the other side was in a
            Romane habit, holding a Table |<note type="foot"><hi rend="italic">start of sig
               A4</hi></note> in one hand, and a Pen in the other, and a white Bend or Diadem about
            his head, his Robe was crimson and Gold, his Mantle yellow and Siluer, his Buskins
            watchet trim’d with Siluer, his haire and Beard long and white with a uenerable aspect,
            standing likewise on a round Pedestall answerable to the other. And in the compartiment
            over him was written NVMA. Above all this in a proportionate distance hung two great
            Festons of fruites in colors which serued for finishing to these sides. The upper part
            in manner of a large Freeze was adorn’d with severall compartiments with draperies
            hanging downe, and the ends tied up in knots, with trophies proper to feasts and
            triumphs, composed of Masking Vizards and torches. In one of the lesser compartiments
            was figured a sharpe sighted eye, and in the other a Golden-yoke, in the midst was a
            more great and rich compartiment on the sides of which sate naked Children in their
            naturall colors, with Siluer wings in action of sounding Golden Trumpets, and in this
            was figured a Caduceus with an Oliue-branch, all which are Hierogliphicks of Peace
            Iustice and Law.</p>

         <p>A Curtaine being sodainly drawne up, the Sceane was discovered representing a large
            streete with Sumptuous Pallaces, Lodges, Portico’s, and other noble peeces of
            Architecture, with pleasant Trees and grounds, this going farre from the eye, opens it
            selfe into a spacious place, adorn’d with publique and private buildings seene a far of,
            representing the Forum or Piazza of Peace. Over all was a | cleare skie with transparent
            clouds, which enlightned all the Scene. </p>

         <p>The Spectators having entertained their eyes a while with the beavty and variety of this
            Scene from one of the sides of the streetes enters Opinion, &amp;c. |</p>

               of the morning; from the furthest part of this ground, arose by little and little a
               great vapour which being come about the middle of the Scene, it slackens its motion,
               and begins to fall downeward to the earth from whence it came: and out of this rose
               another cloud of a strange shape, and colour, on which sate a young Maide, with a
               dimme Torch in her hand, her face was an Olive-colour, so was her armes and breast,
               on her head a curious dressing, and about her necke a string of great Pearle, her
               garment was transparent, the ground darke Blue, and sprinkled with siluer Spangles,
               her Buskins white, trim’d with Gold: by these markes she was knowne to be the
               forerunner of the morning, called by the Ancients Amphiluche, and is that glimps of
               light, which is seene when the night is past, and the day not yet
