  <dc:description>&quot;The Christmas account book for 1614–82 is unique among the surviving records of the Inns, though there must have been others of its kind. It contains receipts and payments of the stewards of Christmas commons and is cited here largely for weekly expenditures on music for the revels. The stewards (of whom there were customarily three or four) entered receipts and expenses for the four weeks of Christmas commons beginning at the feast of St Thomas (21 December) and ending a week after Epiphany. For some years only three weeks of commons are recorded. Expenditures for food and drink are recorded daily, other expenses weekly. The volume also contains the text of some acts of parliament. Accounts for the following years are missing: 1625–6, 1630–1, 1632–40, 1642–60.&quot;</dc:description>
