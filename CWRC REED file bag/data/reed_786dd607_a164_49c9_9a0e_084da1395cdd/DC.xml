  <dc:title>Inner Temple Parliament Book, 1544-45</dc:title>

  <dc:description>Most Inner Temple parliament acts were recorded in a series of Parliament Books. Occasionally, however, acts strayed into other documents, such as the act of 23 December 1624 (see p 213) concerning expenses at Christmas, which survives only in the Christmas Account Book for that year.
               Damaged by fire the three earliest Parliament Books are partly carbonized along all three outside edges, with the result that some lines of text and even whole entries are now illegible. Repaired and rebound c 1960 the volumes remain brittle and difficult to open (especially the first volume in the series).
               The standard essential publication is F.A. Inderwick (ed), A Calendar of the Inner Temple Records, 2 vols (London, 1896, 1898). Lost text can sometimes be supplied from Inderwick.</dc:description>
