  <abstract>Whether this masque was performed in Gray’s Inn Hall is unknown. It was certainly presented at the ‘old’ Banqueting House, Whitehall, and financed (but not written) by Sir Francis Bacon.&#13;
The Masque of Flowers was performed 6 January (Twelfth Night) 1613/14, entered in the Stationers’ Register on 21 January, and published soon thereafter. Music for the masque is printed on sigs C4v–E2 (see Inns of Court Volume 2, Appendix 12, p 783).</abstract>
