         <projectDesc>
            <p>Records of Early English Drama (REED) is an international scholarly project that is establishing for the first time the context from which the drama of Shakespeare and his contemporaries grew. Founded in 1976, REED has worked since then to locate, transcribe, and edit historical documents containing evidence of drama, secular music, and other communal entertainment and ceremony from the Middle Ages until 1642, when the Puritans closed the London theatres.</p>

                     casting vp a banke of Cloudes; in which, a while hee was hidden: but then
                     gloriously shining, gaue that vsually-obseru’d good Omen, of succeeding faire

                     to whose place, wee must referre you for the manner and words; All the time

                     holding vp their <name type="object" subtype="prop">Torches</name> to the Sun;
                     to whome the Priests themselues, and the rest, did as they sung obeisance:

                  <ab> TO answer certaine insolent obiections made against the length of my speeches,
                     and narrations; being (for the probability of all accidents, rising from the
                     inuention of this Maske; and their aplication, to the persons, and places: for
                     whome, and by whome it was presented) not conuenient, but necessary; I am
                     enforct to affirme this; That: as there is no Poem nor Oration so generall; but
                     hath his one perticular proposition; Nor no riuer so extrauagantly ample, but
                     hath his neuer-so-narrow fountaine, worthy to be namd; so all these courtly,
                     and honoring inuentions (hauing Poesie, and Oration in them, and a fountaine,
                     to be exprest, from whence their Riuers flow) should expressiuely-arise; out of
                     the places, and persons for; and by whome they are presented; without which
                     limits, they are luxurious, and paine. But what rules soeuer are set downe, to
                     any Art, or Act (though, without their obseruation; No Art, nor Act, is true,
                     and worthy) yet are they nothing the more followd; or those few that follow
                     them credited. Euery vulgarly-esteemd vpstart; dares breake the dreadfull
                     dignity of antient and autenticall Poesie: and presume Luciferously, to
                     proclame in place thereof, repugnant precepts of their owne spaune. Truth, and
                     Worth, haue no faces, to enamour the Lycentious, but vaine-glory, and humor.
                     The same body: the same beauty, a thousand men seeing: Onely the man whose
                     bloud is fitted, hath that which hee calls his soule, enamourd. And this, out
                     of infallible cause; for, men vnderstand not these of Mænander –––––––––– est

                  <ab> Animæ, quod ictus, vulnus accipit graue. But the cause of all Mens being
                     enamourd with Truth. And of her slight respect, in others; is the diuine
                     Freedom; one touching with his aprehensiue finger, the other, passing. The
                        <placeName>Hill of the Muses</placeName> (which all men must clime in the
                     regular way, to Truth) is said of ould, to be forcked. And the two points of
                     it, parting at the Top; are <placeName>Insania</placeName>, and, diuinus furor.
                     Insania, is that which euery Ranck-brainde writer; and iudge of Poeticall
                     writing, is rapt withal; when hee presumes either to write or censure the
                     height of Poesie; and that transports him with humor, vaine-glory and pride,
                     most prophane and sacrilegious: when diuinus furor; makes gentle, and noble,
                     the neuer so truly-inspired writer –––––––––– </ab>
